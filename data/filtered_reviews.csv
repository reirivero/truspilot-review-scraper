I tried everything else and was even considering stem cells when I came across Winona.  I filled out the form and was contacted within a day. The doctor asked me a few more questions and then prescribed estrogen and DHEA. I had my products the next week and I swear within 3 weeks my hip and back pain were gone. I didn't want to tell anyone with fear it may come back at any time. It's been 3 week and still gone. Dr Peter checked back in with me at 10 weeks asking how everything was going and said he would check back at 1 year again but to please reach out if any concerns or changes. Love this product and that someone was willing to listen to my concerns and not dismiss that they couldn't find anything wrong. It changed my quality of life.

The community of women on Winona’s FB group are super supportive and open about their positive experience and symptom improvement is what convinced me to try.

About 9 weeks in, I started having oily skin and sent a message to my Winona Dr. The next morning I had a response to adjust my Dhea. The responsiveness on the platform is unbelievable.

Then after some research and having that talk with myself - I decided to give Winona a try.  I joined the face book group and read postings everyday, It helped me stay the course when I felt like it wasn't working at times.  So my advise is stay the course, they suggest give it 8-10 weeks.

My night sweats havens been around for about 4 weeks now, I only get a hot flash from time to time but I have found some food triggers them . My evil now is chocolate, hot sauce and fried foods. The DHEA makes me feel like the energizer bunny when I take it mid morning. I'm still trying to adjust my macros/ meals and timings to see what works best for me now as the DHEA suppresses my appetite- Cream at night before bed.

I started HRT 10 weeks ago and every one of these symptoms have improved dramatically! I’m sleeping better, I don’t feel like a crazy person in a constant fog, and seldom have a hot flash now, but best of all my husband and I have a renewed sex life! I am now off all other meds for depression and anxiety and finally feel like myself again! My only regret is not starting sooner! I know HRT isn’t for everyone, but it has been life changing for me!

I just didn't believe what everyone was telling me that I should just live with how I was feeling, that it was just going to get worse and heard over and over again ""It's how everyone goes through menopause"".Then I found Winona.  These products work. As soon as I started applying the cream, it was instant relief of the night sweats and I found I could sleep again through the night. In a few weeks, I started seeing my mood shift and just recently I feel the bloating and weight gain finally starting to subside.  I've been on the products for a little over 10 weeks and I am so happy I found them.  They are truly a lifesaver for me. I am feeling more and more like my old self and so many people notice the shift in my mood. I don't feel bloated or have the blahs anymore.

I felt like I was trapped in a stranger’s body. Poor sleep, dry skin, joints that hurt all the time, packed on 20+ pounds in less than a year  and NO sex drive. The worst was the sex drive. It hurt my heart because my husband and I had always shared this beautiful, intimate physical love that mirrored our feelings for each other. Conceptually, I wanted sex, but it was just too much effort  suddenly. I also had began to hate my body, the body that had weathered so much and given life to 3 children. The one I should have been proud of. I had doctors’ say, “Yep, menopause sucks,” and “deal with it.” There seemed to be no hope.So I took a risk. Did this thing online. Took a quiz. Corresponded with a doctor and got some meds from Winona. The process was easy. The service was great. I feel that I am in control now and have choices.I have more energy, I feel better. I am starting to recognize this 56 year old body again. It will be a long journey back to my desired shape. I’d say sleep has improved, but the newly found desire for intimacy is keeping us both up for hours at night! Guess I need to learn how to take naps!",04 October 2022,,,,0.08752272727272727,0.0
