I’m resubmitting a shortened version.  I do not recommend midi health. The service is not proactive in staying in touch with their patients. They do not communicate well and are not responsive to messages.  You have to follow-up with the service often several times to get answer.  When they do provide a response, it often is not clear and creates more questions that they also can’t answer or are take an unreasonable amount of time to answer.  The platform they use to schedule appointments and message is also a terrible platform which adds to the problem.It roughly a month to get an insurance issue resolved, partly due to their billing team’s errors. Once the insurance issue was resolved, I took a required lab test.  The lab results were submitted to the Midi on 8/28.  I waited to see if they would reach out to me.  I did not hear from them, so I contacted them on 09/08 - par for the course.My first and only appointment so far with Midi was on 07/11/2024.  It is 09/09/2024 and I’m still trying to get the services they advertised and move this process forward.I would suggest going to a Midi Health competitor instead of Midi.

I first met with Emily Amoe, NP, via the MIDI app about 2 months ago and was prescribed HRT (not birth control, but an Estradiol patch & progesterone pill) for my symptoms which included hot flashes, night sweats, brain fog and joint pain. First, I want to point out that Emily exhibited more concern for my symptoms than my OBGYN & my GP combined; it was the first time I’d ever felt truly cared for during a health examination in relation to menopause. No rush, genuine concern. Emily prescribed HRT and throughout the last 2 months and 1 dose increase, I have felt a level of relief I didn’t think possible. I feel like I felt in my 20s, and even look better than I have in a decade - younger, brighter, fresher.

The voicemail on the phone says to send an email- which then takes days for someone to write back without a solution. My “care provider” wrote me a prescription but did not give the pharmacy all the information they needed to fill it. The pharmacy could not get through to anyone at MIDI to get the information. For whatever reason, MIDI decided to transfer my prescription to another pharmacy then another. The 3rd pharmacy is STILL waiting for information from MIDI. Still.

Once I was sure my insurance covered it (must be a PPO or you can pay out of pocket), I made an appointment. Before the appointment, I had to answer a few questions about my menopause journey and effects of menopause in my life. I was then paired with Kellie Gautier, NP who was kind, knowledgeable and a great listener.  I was prescribed HRT. We also chatted about bone health, managing weight, and types of exercise. As far as HRT, it takes a few weeks for everything to level set. However, I’m very relieved that I’m at least on a journey to improve my symptoms. HRT can be tweaked if needed as per the NP.

I assumed it was a clerical error so called and was told that my insurance didn't actually cover it and that I'd been sent an email informing me of this prior to my visit. This is not true. I've checked my inbox and junk folders and no such email was sent, just lots of emails welcoming me and confirming my visit. Had I known I would have cancelled the visit since I can't afford to pay out of pocket. I've just gone on the BBB complaints page and found several one-star reviews with exactly the same story so I now believe this deceitful behavior is standard Midi practice.

There is no response to emails, nobody answers the phone and if they do, they have to somehow be the intermediary between you and your provider and apparently zero accountability for what was communicated to me over the phone only by Cheryl Miller.  How is this service even legal? Let alone ethical? Naturally I will be copying and pasting all of this into a letter to Government Agencies which should be regulating this sort of thing as I can honestly see this type of business doing more harm than it does good, given the nature of what it is purporting to try to help (in a landscape where the medical industry is already so far lacking in support and available services).

2024-09-12 19:20:11,Info for Anne,Anne,US,,Billing / Insurance / Responsiveness Issues,1.0,2024-08-09T20:46:02.000Z,"I am so frustrated with this company.  I was looking for a partner in my perimenopause journey and I selected the wrong company.  I have not had much experience yet with the health care service providers yet because I’ve been mired down with the billing / insurance team.  My initial appointment was just shy of a month ago and they’re still trying to figure out coverage.  The company also has communication and responsiveness problems.  The portal they use for scheduling appointments, messaging, etc. is difficult to use and doesn’t work well.  Their auto-reply when a patient submits a message reads that the company will reply in 2 business days.  They do not honor that statement.  In general, I’ve waited and waited for them to reply to me and typically have to follow-up with the company, sometimes many times, to get a question answered or to get movement on a request.  Responses are far from clear and typically generates more questions which starts the frustrating communication loop all over again.I submitted my insurance information shortly after my initial visit and was told it would be forwarded to the billing department or the billing department would reach out to me.  I don’t think my information was ever forwarded.  I waited and waited for someone to reach out, but never heard anything, so I followed up.  I was asked for my insurance information again.  I submitted images of the front and back of my card through their portal.  A week goes by and I heard nothing, so I followed up again.  They asked for my insurance information again and directed me to a portal to submit my information again.   Finally, I was told that my insurance would cover my initial consultation.  This whole process took from July 11th to August 1st.That seemed to finally clear up the coverage issue, so I messaged to ask when I could expect communication regrading the next steps in my healthcare plan or when I could expect the lab I discussed with my LNP to be ordered.  No response again.  This time I only waited for three business days to lapse before reaching out again to try and get the process back on track.  At that point I was thanked for reaching out regarding my prior authorization and told to order the lab myself.  I asked for clarification as I was told my initial consultation was covered.  I assume the prior authorization is for the lab and assume that I should wait for the prior authorization to come through before scheduling it, but who knows because the company isn’t clear in its replies and who knows if someone from the company will ever respond.  I sent another follow-up this morning.  We’ll see.I have been told that the billing team is understaffed and down to three people or so.  Understand the resource problem, but perhaps stop accepting new patients until you can adequately service them all.If you’re looking to explore treatment for perimenopause symptoms or anything else, I would seek out another company that offers those services.  Coming to this company will only add to perimenopause frustrations.  The company certainly is not a partner in the way it holds itself out to be.","August 09, 2024",Reply from Midi Health,2024-08-09T21:21:38.000Z,"Hi Anne!

2024-09-12 19:20:11,Info for Dara,Dara,US,,"Pros and Cons of Midi. Sadly, many more Cons",2.0,2024-07-18T22:06:37.000Z,"I used Midi for almost two years, ending in December 2023. There are pros and cons to working with them, but unfortunately the cons won.They are good at providing basic peri, menopause and post menopausal care. If you are having issues you feel are related to peri/meno/post menopause, talk to them.However, I did not find any of the providers to be at all innovative. Meaning they came up with solid, reasonable solutions for the many symptoms of menopause care. Which is fine, if all you need is basic. Which at the time, is all I needed. Had I gone to them early in peri-menopause or menopause, I am not convinced they could have helped me as my symptoms were awful. Importantly, your care is only as good as the people Midi matches you with. They will not match you with a doctor, but rather a NP (Nurse Practitioner) who specializes in menopause care. I assume the doctors are too expensive to meet with, or the NP all consult with doctors behind the scenes. I do not know.That being said, the NPs do not seem to stick around very long. You will work with someone, like them, and then they leave. That does not speak well of Midi.The downside, and this is a big one, is that the online-only messaging system SUCKS. It is very hard to get a response from anyone, especially in a timely manner. They seem to have an endless stream of office people, and little communication between them. Every response is from a different name, and they seem to have no accountability. They are astoundingly unhelpful, even with basic things like getting messages to your provider. Having said that, it seems that even the providers take a long time to get back to you, even with serious problems.In addition, they do not use a customer service app (ex. Zendesk) that would make it easy and streamlined. Your only recourse is through the janky, low tech website.And, the usability of their platform is ridiculously bad. It is very 2001, low tech and confusing to use. I complained about it in 2022, and they said they were ""working on it."" It looks like they have not.Recently, I reached out to them with a medical query related to my time with them. Despite no longer being a ""member"", the request is in regards to the time I WAS a member. So, why not answer my message? I am not asking for an appointment, only paperwork! I find that to be not only rude, but unethical. And, further underlines why I stopped using them.","July 09, 2024",Reply from Midi Health,2024-07-18T21:59:35.000Z,"Hi Dara!

I look forward to continue my health journey with Midi. 7/11/24 Update: I took a star off my review, because when they said my insurance was accepted I assumed it covered the consultation with the provider, but it did not. I was charged $250.00. I was not informed this would not be covered.

I met with one of the MIDI practitioners and reviewed all of my symptoms. She was very quick to suggest I go on a low dose estrogen patch and progesterone pills. When I inquired about a blood panel to ensure this was the proper direction for my healthcare, as well as understanding what dosage I needed, she said we can certainly do that but it will not dictate or change our action plan. When I asked her to elaborate she said we are treating your symptoms and so regardless what your blood test would say it would not change my recommendation, but if it makes you feel better I can order your labs. Regardless, we will start you on a low dose and meet every few weeks to see how you're feeling, and then we would increase that subsequent dose if your symptoms are not improving. She also suggested how much this hormone replacement would solve for other symptoms that I didn't even have, which was also a red flag. Her lack of personalization and then suggesting blood work wasn't relevant, was a major pause for me. I decided to seek out another health care partner that specialized in women's health care, but based their recommendations on your blood work for a more personalized approach. In my consult with my new practitioner they said you can absolutely tell how much hormone replacement a person needs based on what their levels are at the point they had the blood taken within their cycle, so you would absolutely be able to more personalize a dosage if that is even needed at all. They also said it's extremely dangerous for women to be prescribed HRT without blood work to confirm if and what is needed. When my blood work came back I found out that I actually have an autoimmune disorder with my thyroid as my underlying condition to all the symptoms I experienced. And guess what, my estrogen and progesterone levels are completely normal!! The only sex hormone in question is that my testosterone levels are a little low, so not quite optimal but technically within range. All of this is to say that if I had stayed with MIDI I would have been mistreated with a hormone supplement that was not needed at all. In fact, my new physician care suggested that had they put me on estrogen and continue to increase the dosage, which was not needed, it would have made my thyroid situation far worse because estrogen imbalance also can accelerate hypothyroidism, causing me more harm and making it much harder to get under control. I just want to send a caution for anyone seeking support through MIDI Health, thinking you will get personalized health care. They are looking for symptoms that ""could"" mean you have a decline in estrogen or progesterone, and they will treat your symptoms on that premise only but not actually look for the root cause to really help your long-term health. I was extremely disappointed to know that had I not been an advocate for my own health care, I would have been prescribed drugs that were absolutely unnecessary and would have caused me more harm. A lot of symptoms we experience in our bodies can mimic a decline in estrogen or other sex hormones, it doesn't mean that's the actual problem so I highly suggest women get blood work first before allowing people to prescribe them unnecessary medication. I'm thankful that now I'm on the path to restore my health and addressing the thyroid issue that was truly the underlying cause of my symptoms. Midi is clearly out to prescribe as much hormone replacement drugs to as many women as possible for financial gain. If they can fit your symptoms into their box of even the possibility that you would benefit from their prescription, you will be offered it no questions asked. Secondarily, they said my insurance would not cover my $250 visit and continue to send me a bill. I had to contact the billing office multiple times to tell them to send it through my insurance and if it is not covered I will take care of it. Turns out my insurance did cover it after all, So if nothing else I'm glad I didn't lose the $250 out of pocket to this company. Take charge of your health and be your own advocate, get your blood work to confirm it's actually what you need!","May 09, 2024",Reply from Midi Health,2024-06-24T13:34:38.000Z,"Hi Kelly,Thank you so much for your feedback.

The sheer lack of respect for my time was astounding.Not only did I waste precious time waiting, but the clinician's tardiness and subsequent request to reschedule were wholly unprofessional and unacceptable. It's evident that MIDI Health lacks the basic organizational skills necessary to manage appointments effectively.I had hoped for a professional and timely consultation, but instead, I was met with incompetence and disregard.

After years of my long list of strange symptoms being ignored by doctors, or I was told to ""just hang on"" through perimenopause, they were the first to actually provide relief.  I was very skeptical about Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but they took the time to educate me with the research to back it about how I was misinformed about the dangers of HRT and how HRT can have multiple positive benefits. I decided to try it and I am so glad I did.  Symptoms I didn't even know were related to perimenopause were resolved.  My OBGYN told me I just need antidepressants and a therapist.  Midi understood I needed HRT. All aspects of my life have been impacted by this journey.  I am so grateful to have a provider than truly understands what is happening and has solutions!  Don't waste another second thinking about it, schedule a call with Midi.Also, even if your insurance doesn't cover them, their fees are VERY reasonable.

As a 50-year-old perimenopausal woman with major depressive disorder, anxiety, past suicidal ideation, ADHD, and ASD, I have faced numerous challenges in my mental health journey. Anna's impact on my life has been profound, and I am grateful for her unwavering support and guidance.From our very first session, Anna exuded warmth, compassion, and genuine care. She created a safe, non-judgmental space where I felt comfortable sharing my struggles and vulnerabilities. Anna's ability to listen attentively and validate my experiences has been instrumental in my healing process. Unlike some of my past experiences with medical professionals, Anna never dismissed or downplayed my concerns. Instead, she took the time to understand the intricacies of my conditions and tailored her approach to meet my specific needs.One instance stands out: Anna's support made a difference. I had previously encountered difficulties with other medical professionals who seemed dismissive of my multiple diagnoses and the challenges they presented. However, Anna took the time to thoroughly educate herself about each of my conditions and their interactions. Her knowledge and expertise validated my experiences and gave me a sense of relief and reassurance that I was in capable hands.Beyond her professional expertise, Anna's unwavering support and encouragement have instilled a newfound sense of hope within me; as someone who has battled major depressive disorder and past suicidal ideation, finding hope can be a daunting task. However, Anna's belief in my potential and constant reminders of my strength has been transformative. She has helped me recognize my intrinsic value and worth, even in the darkest moments.One aspect that sets Anna apart is her ability to see the bigger picture. She has encouraged me to explore my life experiences and consider writing a book about my journey, which has been a burning desire of mine over the past few years. Her support has ignited a newfound passion for writing and self-expression, opening doors to self-discovery and personal growth. I can confidently say that my experience with Anna would be mentioned in my book should I figure out how to explore the book-writing scene.In conclusion, Anna Lederman at Midi Health has profoundly impacted my life over the past 15 months. Her warmth, compassion, and validation have provided me with the support I needed to navigate my perimenopause challenges. Anna's expertise and dedication to understanding my unique circumstances have been invaluable. Her unwavering belief in my potential, encouragement, and support have helped me find hope and recognize my self-worth. I am eternally grateful for Anna's guidance on my journey toward healing and self-discovery. I have never met a medical professional like her. Midi Health is beyond fortunate to have her on their team. She is making a profound impact on the lives of women experiencing perimenopause. The world absolutely NEEDS more practitioners like Anna.","April 10, 2024",,,

Unfortunately, so far, I have been dissatisfied with the level of care and attention that I have received from Midi Health's practitioners. My initial consult with an NP was fine. At the end of the consult, the NP told me that she'd need to order labs for me before I started taking HRT, but she needed to know which lab.  Minutes after the consult ended, I messaged the NP to provide the specific lab and location. Two weeks later, I'd heard nothing from the NP or Midi Health about the lab order. I had to dig around on the (very basic, not user friendly) website to determine whether my labs had ever been ordered. When it appeared they had not, I messaged the NP to inquire. She then apologized and ordered the labs. If that had been the only negative experience, no big deal. But it only got worse from there. When I printed out the lab order to take to my lab, I noticed that the NP hadn't ordered a hormone panel. But she had ordered a bunch of other general tests, like Vitamin D and cholesterol. I thought that was odd; wasn't the whole point to get a baseline on my hormone levels before I started HRT? But since I'm not a medical professional, I again messaged my NP to ask.  It turned out that the original NP was on vacation, so a different person was covering for her.  That person responded that no, a hormone panel wasn't necessary, and attached a long scientific ""treatise"" to prove it. I thought that was a little odd, but okay.... she's a medical professional and I am not. At my next consultation with my NP, who had by then returned from vacation, it was immediately obvious that she hadn't reviewed my lab results before the call started. After I mentioned that I had taken the labs and results were in, she wasted 5 minutes of our session reviewing them.When the NP mentioned that there was no hormone panel result, I inwardly rolled my eyes. ""You didn't order one,"" I replied, ""and when I asked your covering NP about whether the panel had been omitted in error, she said it wasn't necessary."" The NP looked at me blankly, responding: ""It's a good idea to order a hormone panel to establish a baseline level before you start HRT.""Oh, is it? Then why did: (1) You not order that panel, and (2) your covering NP tell me it was actually NOT advised (the opposite of what you're saying now)?So now I have to go back to the lab to take yet another panel. And honestly, I feel completely uncared-for by my NP, and uncomfortable with the inconsistencies in Midi Health's policies that would result in diametrically opposite advice from two different NPs on the need to get a hormone panel. In conclusion, I am questioning my decision to use Midi Health. I will likely discontinue using the service, and find a specialist doctor instead.","March 12, 2024",Reply from Midi Health,2024-03-13T22:12:07.000Z,"Thank you for sharing your experience with us.
