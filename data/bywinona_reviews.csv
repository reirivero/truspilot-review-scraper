I’m back to my college athlete weight 122lbs and feeling really good and healthy. My energy levels are way up. My joints are not popping and crackling as much and I’d say my overall mood is much better. It seems like everything would upset me prior to starting Winona. I feel more level headed and even keeled now. 💜",12 September 2024,,,

The education and live sessions with the Docs have been so informative, honest and refreshing. I am yet; another Winona patient, whose only regret is that I didn’t start sooner. I have been post menopausal for 5 years and I know that my life and transition could have been so much better if I started HRT earlier. I cannot say enough about how much better my quality of life is since starting with Winona. I have four sisters and because of companies like Winona, we have so much more access to quality care that truly can change the way we feel and age as women.

I tried everything else and was even considering stem cells when I came across Winona.  I filled out the form and was contacted within a day. The doctor asked me a few more questions and then prescribed estrogen and DHEA. I had my products the next week and I swear within 3 weeks my hip and back pain were gone. I didn't want to tell anyone with fear it may come back at any time. It's been 3 week and still gone. Dr Peter checked back in with me at 10 weeks asking how everything was going and said he would check back at 1 year again but to please reach out if any concerns or changes. Love this product and that someone was willing to listen to my concerns and not dismiss that they couldn't find anything wrong. It changed my quality of life. Thank you,10 September 2024,,,

I think the marketing heavily focuses on getting relief right away and having personal tailored care but then to be told your medication can't be adjusted until three months is so disappointing. For someone like me I know right away how a medication affects my body but the way they do follow ups does not allow for that. After sufferring through debilitating symptoms before my 3 month follow up I was able to get my  medication adjusted and am doing much better now. But it was very emotionally and physically painful to wait the initial 3 months when I knew the dosage was not working.,19 August 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-09-12T12:39:14.000Z,"We apologize for any confusion regarding the Follow Up process, KB.  The doctors do recommend allowing around 10-12 weeks to see how your body will adjust to the medications before any adjustments are made.  Those first few months are not always a true reflection of how effective your treatment plan will be. We do strive to provide personalized HRT to match your symptoms and needs, and acknowledge that the initial three month period can be challenging for some individuals. We appreciate your feedback and will use it to improve our communication regarding medication adjustments and the timeline involved.A Patient Care Representative has emailed you for further support, and we are glad to hear that you are now doing better with your adjusted medication!"

The community of women on Winona’s FB group are super supportive and open about their positive experience and symptom improvement is what convinced me to try. The process with Winona is relatively seamless and all of my questions were answered prior to agreeing to accept the prescription. My meds arrived ahead of schedule and almost immediately I started to see an improvement of symptoms. 10 weeks in and feel like my old self. About 9 weeks in, I started having oily skin and sent a message to my Winona Dr. The next morning I had a response to adjust my Dhea. The responsiveness on the platform is unbelievable.

If you don't list any questions, and the doctor deems you a good candidate for HRT, he or she may proceed with your treatment plan.  It is understood that you are seeking relief, and we would like to help you get that relief!We do caution women that it can take around 3 months or more to see results, as it takes time for your body to adjust to the influx of hormones. However, if you do not see any relief after that amount of time, your Winona doctor is more than happy to tweak your medications to get you the relief you need!  They don't want to over prescribe right out of the gate, nor do they want to under prescribe and have you suffer. We also do try to process your prescriptions as fast as possible, because we understand when you are suffering, that every day can feel like a year.  We do provide our patients with an opportunity to cancel any order that they do not want, and you are not forced into any subscription agreement. It appears that your prescriptions are still active.

This Ad should mention this.,19 August 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-08-20T12:36:30.000Z,"Thanks for your feedback, Kathryn.Unfortunately, many people have fears related to HRT due to inaccurate information that came out during the Women's Health Initiative.We write extensively about this in our peer-reviewed & cited Medical Journal. A popular article is one that debunks the common misconceptions and myths around menopause and HRT. You can read that article here: https://bywinona.com/journal/truths-and-myths-about-menopause/​﻿﻿As far as HRT causing cancer, studies have shown that women receiving bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (HRT) do not have any apparent increased risks for cancer, clots, or strokes. The article I linked above explores this further.​﻿﻿It's also worth mentioning that our hormones are not sourced from animals but instead, are derived from plants.A confirmed personal history of cancer is a contraindication to HRT, but a family history is not. We ask women about their health history during their onboarding process, and we do not accept anyone who is not an appropriate candidate. For women who do have a family history of cancer and are concerned about their risks, our doctors may recommend genetic testing.We would love to elaborate on our process with you, but we cannot locate an account under your name as it is listed here.

They rolled in every 2 hours and lasted 20 minutes. I was losing sleep and becoming very upset. My doc told me she couldn’t recommend HRT because I’m too young and they only want to put me on it for a max of 5 years because of the risk of breast cancer. I deep dive into this told me this information is incorrect. Desperate for rest, I signed up with  Winona and one other company to compare. Winona recommended a compounded cream that has estrogen & progesterone. The other company recommended an estrogen patch and a progesterone pill. Since apparently the pill has a few side effects (bloating, tiredness, breast tenderness) and the cream does not, I went with Winona and the cream. It took longer than I expected to take effect. The hot flashes started lessening after 3 weeks, and it took 7 to eliminate them entirely, but now they’re gone and I am so flipping relieved.",15 August 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-08-16T10:37:21.000Z,"Thank you so much for sharing your journey.

The 3-month supply for both was about $250. I took it as prescribed for 90 days and if anything, my menopause symptoms increased, with more weight gain and more fatigue. When I told the prescribing doctor that my symptoms were unchanged, they just offered to increase the dosage. At this point I need to just suck it up and visit an in-person menopause practicioner and try something else.I feel like I got suckered in by all the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I'm disappointed that it didn't work and I gained 10 lbs and am out $250. Not saying mail order bioidentical estrogen doesn't work...but this didn't work for me. This review will probably never see the light of day, as I'm sure Winona scrubs negative reviews.",03 August 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-08-12T12:46:19.000Z,"Thank you for your feedback, Mimi!We do not ""scrub"" any negative reviews, and always want our patients to be honest and open about their experiences with us as it helps us to improve our services.We are saddened to hear that your body did not adjust to your treatment plan as you had hoped. Bioidentical HRT helps most women, but as with all medical interventions, there are no guarantees. Most women see improvement after a few weeks, and we can say that 80% of patients are satisfied with how they feel around the three-month mark.​If your symptoms have not improved after 10-weeks, we can change the dose or the medication to try to help you feel better.It can take time for your body to acclimate to the influx of hormones. These are real prescription medications, prescribed by real doctors, just like you would receive in a doctor's office. The only difference between Winona and your personal doctor is that we conduct our visits via telehealth. Be assured that your Winona doctor is available if problems arise or if you have any questions about treatment. We are committed to helping you find the appropriate medication and dose that benefits you the most.A member of our Patient Care team has emailed you for further support!"

Your Winona doctor is more than happy to work with you to find the exact treatment plan to get you the results you are seeking!A member of our Patient Care Team has emailed you for further support!"

Weight gain also was a major factor for going on Winona. After 3 months, I still have some issues with sleeping all the way through the night and no change in my weight, unfortunately. I’m a healthy and balanced eater so this was a disappointment after reading so many success stories. When I wrote the doctor, she recommended doubling my cream and DHEA intake. I obliged and experienced nausea, irritability and not being able to sleep for over a week. I immediately went back to my original dosage amount and felt relief. Not very impressed with my doctors communication as they prescribe almost as a side hustle. I also find their recent marketing tactics that are now everywhere in my social media feeds to be incredibly condescending, and not informative. I’m a professional woman who wants reputable information without the sarcasm. I appreciate humor but not when you are desperate for relief. I was also eager to be part of Winona’s online community where I could ask questions on nutrition, other women’s experiences but none of my posts were accepted for posting. So you have to sift through hundreds of posts to find information that may not even be relevant to your question while still following their community guidelines. I will be consulting with my regular OBGYN who is difficult to book on other alternatives. Ill stay on until then as Winona helped with the night sweats and brain fog. I do appreciate the no wait to start their prescriptions. I wish their was more relief and more professionalism with their community and platform.",14 August 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-08-15T12:38:44.000Z,"Thank you for sharing your experience with us, Betsy.We understand your frustration with the lack of progress in your sleep and weight management goals despite starting HRT, and we are sorry!We know it's disheartening, despite following your Winona doctor's guidance.

Men don’t loose anything. This causes a lot of discord in relationships. Well after Winona that has changed. Everything is better. First and foremost I have suffered with arthritis and joint pain for years. Now I go days without even thinking about the pain. I have more energy. But most of all “the lady parts” have WOKEN up!! I wish I had found this years ago. Now I feel like I have so much time to make up for. The drudgery is gone! It’s fun again. No more dread. If anything I get irritated because it doesn’t happen more. I can’t say enough about this treatment. My husband has taken DHEA for years, which I feel has helped him stay young. He doesn’t look or act his age. I use to hate to see him take it because I knew it increased his drive. It was the easiest process to start. The doctors are quick to answer and very helpful and encouraging. I tell my friends about this but I wish I could shout it from the rooftops.

Because having traditional, in person appointments has been the norm for so long, communicating over a computer can seem  cold and impersonal. Your doctor can answer more specifically for you, as symptoms and intensity vary, but most women feel relief from treatment within the first month. Within 3 months, 80% of women feel complete relief from their symptoms.That is why we ask you to check in at the 10 week mark to see if any adjustments need to be made. If you are still having symptoms, your Winona doctor can work with you to increase your dosages. We do ask you several straightforward questions about your treatment plan, but there is also section that allows you to freely communicate your questions and concerns to the doctor. They truly do want to help you feel your best and address any issues you may be having!Feel free to communicate as much as you desire....we want you to be happy with your treatment plan and get the results you are looking for!"

This was the most surprising effect out of all of my positive results—this is not to say I am at my personal best in terms of weight, but I do see a thinning throughout my legs, midsection and arms.

This hormonal weight gain will also be distributed differently, and may leave us feeling more round in places that we don't want to be round!Once hormone levels are optimal with the right treatment plan, and the metabolic effects of declining hormone levels are reversed, weight loss can then be possible.Better, more stable moods, and improved quality of our hair and skin are also welcome benefits of HRT!We appreciate the 5 stars!"

2024-09-12 19:29:15,Info for Emily,Emily,US,,Not One Size Fits All,2.0,2024-07-26T21:39:55.000Z,"In theory this program seems great but there are many limitations to receiving internet-based care. I did like the use of bioidentical hormones and the compounded estrogen/progesterone cream. I hate taking pills if I don't have to. They were shipped before you ran out and you were able to customize with either one additional pump or one less pump of cream based on how you were responding. The doctor was nice as long as you didn't ask too many questions. These are doctors who have full-time jobs already and this is generally a side gig for them for more income I'm sure, so don't expect more personalized care.That being said, you fill out an initial questionnaire and it seems they have a standard formula they like to start people on. This also includes the use of DHEA. Despite the fact that my testosterone levels and DHEA levels were significantly too high the doctor insisted it was beneficial to use, for what reason I'm not sure. I ultimately had to stop taking it because of the side effects which wasted 2.5 months worth of medication. You do have the option to refill your medications monthly but they encourage the 3-month prescription since changes will not be made anyway until after your 10-week review (it's just another questionnaire you fill out, not an actual visit with your doctor). Refilling monthly ends up being more expensive but if you have any doubts it may be worth doing that for your first 3 months just to make sure this is for you. Treatment is not based on lab work which is fine to a point, however if anything presents itself that can make it more difficult to figure out appropriate treatment they are either not prepared to work through that, don't have the time or don't care to. Heaven forbid you bring up concerns or questions about increased blood pressure, increased weight gain, ongoing unresolved symptoms or new symptoms- they just end your treatment. It's definitely an investment and for 3 months of basic treatment will run you upwards of $300. You can choose to do estrogen and progesterone pills or cream, they want you to take DHEA pills since they are unable to prescribe testosterone, they offer a female Viagra so to speak and I think a few other miscellaneous things. So for those who are fortunate enough to only need a little dose of hormones to make you right again, this program will be fine. For those who tend to have a more difficult menopause it's probably best to try and find an actual in-person physician who is willing to make the effort to try and resolve your symptoms. Hormones do have side effects and for some people pose a greater risk when taking them, despite what every single doctor may say about the ones they prescribe. Don't let them gaslight you into thinking otherwise. Just do your homework because this program is not for everybody. Lesson learned. *By Winona, if you respond, you will not find my specific information in your system because this is my new email address. Either way, I don't need a response and I just outlined the general information for your program as well as my experience with it. Definitely not the worst that's on this review platform. Thank you.",03 June 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-07-29T02:18:59.000Z,"We appreciate your feedback, Emily, as we do strive every day to provide our patients with treatment and service worthy of 5 stars.   We take all comments seriously, good or bad, and do try to maintain a professional and trustworthy plan of care for you.Unfortunately, as you indicated,  we cannot locate an account under your name as it is listed here.  You did not provide any email address.You are correct that HRT is not prescribed based on lab work.It is prescribed based on symptoms, in accordance with the AMA, NAMS, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists.Our Winona doctors review the health history and onboarding information that you provide and prescribe a treatment plan that they feel would benefit you the most. All of our doctors are board-certified, well established, and specialize in the care of women going through the menopause transition, something that is lacking for women in today's world. We take your health and safety very seriously and will not accept anyone who is not a candidate for HRT. Our primary focus is not based on monetary goals, but rather a goal of providing women safe and effective HRT who may not otherwise have access to it. The decision to receive a 1 month supply or a 3 month supply of medication is totally up to the patient.  We have no preference for the amount that can be prescribed to you, as we are acutely aware that cost is a factor for many women.  The 3 month supply is cheaper in the long run, but we have many women who opt to only receive a monthly prescription. Our treatments help most women, but as with all medical interventions, there are no guarantees.  This applies to online providers as well as brick and mortar providers. Fortunately, the majority of women do not experience any side effects at all.  For those that do, they usually only occur in the initial few weeks of treatment as the body is adjusting to the increased hormone levels. Bloating, breast tenderness, nausea, etc. are usually short lived and manageable. Most women see improvement after a few weeks, and we can say that 80% of patients are satisfied with how they feel around the three-month mark.  It can be hard to acclimate to an online platform for your health care needs, and our Winona doctors understand this.   They always provide you ongoing support and guidance to ensure you have the best treatment plan for your symptoms. ​If your symptoms have not improved after 10-weeks, we can change the dose or the medication to try to help you feel better. However, it can take time for your body to acclimate to the influx of hormones. These are real prescription medications, prescribed by real doctors, just like you would receive in a doctor's office. Again, be assured that your Winona doctor is available if problems arise or if you have any questions about treatment.We are committed to helping you find the appropriate medication and dose that benefits you the most and would love the opportunity to resolve any issues that you may have encountered. Please contact our Patient Care Team at hello@bywinona.com.We look forward to hearing from  you!"

I had no idea that join pain, bloating and anxiety were manifestations of perimenopause!I do have a hysterectomy so I feel like the risk of perimenopause could have been detected if even one doctor had looked at my chart in context just once in the last 5 years. I've been told the severe joint pain was all in my head. I was told having one ovary meant HRT wasn't necessary.For the last year I've felt exhausted, bloated and unable to focus on anything. Constant anxiety. I thought I was literally dying and nothing I could say would convince any doctor that I had a real problem. I've gained a ton of weight that was impossible to lose. By the time I saw the Winona facebook ad I had little faith that anything would help. I was pretty convinced I was dying from some undiagnosed medical condition. I gave up going to the doctor because they offered no help and treated me like I was stupid.I was wrong and pleasantly surprised. After taking my first dose I slept through the entire night and woke up with significantly less joint pain! After a couple weeks, the bloating and gastro problems I've been experiencing for YEARS have completely cleared up. I've only lost a couple pounds, but I feel like a real person again!The Winona process was simple and everything went the way it should. I'm so grateful they exist because I'd also given up going to the doctor to fight with them about my symptoms. I'm really glad I gave it a chance! Now I am telling everyone because I'm so mad it took a facebook ad to cure me.If you are looking to feel normal again and think this even has a remote possibility of being an issue for you, I really recommend it. The difference for me is night and day and I really can't believe all the problems that HRT has resolved. It's like a mirace!",22 July 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-07-23T12:42:23.000Z,"For much of medical history, women's needs and their right to quality health care has been very limited, if non-existent for certain diagnoses. Women are viewed as ""complicated"" or ""complainers"" who should be able to deal with their own health issues, especially when it comes to menopause.Winona understands this, Hilary, and we are trying to change the view on menopause and it's treatment!Women should not have to suffer!  And if they are suffering, then they should be able to have their symptoms addressed and resolved!The menopause transition can affect every system in the body - cognitive, muscular, cardiovascular, bones and joints, vision, etc., and it can definitely make you feel like your life is ending.The process is even more harsh and dramatic for those women who have their ovaries removed, as your body immediately has no way to produce adequate levels of hormones that you need. It's disheartening to hear that your symptoms were dismissed for so long and that you felt unheard by medical professionals. However, we are THRILLED that you found relief through Winona and that you're feeling better now!We appreciate you sharing your story and hope it helps others who may be struggling with similar issues to know that we can help them too!"

I reached out to this company because I am going through peri-menopause. I am 50 years old and am on birth control for the first time to control extremely heavy periods. I am not ready to commit to full HRT but the past year I have noticed a drop in libido and dryness like the Sahara Desert! My skin was itchy. Down there became itchy. Sex became uncomfortable as well as just different. And the bottle of lubrication with a pump wasn’t my favorite piece of decor. I came across By Winona on Instagram and gave it a go. Someone told me about DHEA so that is what I inquired about. I am now at 11 weeks and what a change! I noticed the changes after the first 2 weeks. No longer itchy anywhere and have not used lubrication since starting it. I don’t know if it’s just placebo but I feel 17 again. The mental part of my sex drive still comes and goes but satisfaction and comfort level while it’s happening is at an all time high. Both myself and my husband could not be happier.

Until doom scrolling popped up Winona.  From the comfort of my living room, in just a few minutes, I had a doctor!  No waiting an hour passed my appt time in a drab room. She was super responsive to my questions, and my meds arrived quickly. Three months later, I'm sleeping deeper and longer each night. I'm happier, more alert during the day. My focus is incredible, to the point coworkers ask how I get so much done each day. Best of all, my flash fits if irritation and rage are gone. I'm me again. Without side effects.

2024-09-12 19:29:18,Info for TG,TG,US,,Winona wasn’t right for me,1.0,2024-07-18T04:58:36.000Z,"Winona wasn’t right for me. First, the prescription for HRT seemed to be a generic, “one size fits all” type of approach. Without any real review of my personal health history, I was prescribed a progesterone/estrogen cream and DHEA supplement. Shortly afterwards, my face exploded with acne. I have had acne my entire adult life, and it significantly worsened with the initial treatment. I did some independent research and discovered that DHEA elevates testosterone levels. Prior to trying Winona, I had had my hormone levels tested, and my testosterone was already too high and out of normal range. Winona never asked about prior labs or hormone levels, and I never actually spoke to a doctor before my a prescription was given; they just assumed that this supplement should be given. When I asked to discontinue the supplement, it was a bit of a hassle. Instead of listening to my concerns, the rep I spoke to kept trying to sell me on the “benefits” of HRT. After I told her multiple times that I was having a bad reaction to the medication and did not need to increase my already too high testosterone levels, she told me I needed to speak to one of their doctors to get permission to cancel my subscription to the DHEA. Once resolved, I did continue to use the cream. However, Winona refused to provide information I needed to get reimbursed by my insurance company for the costs. Before selecting an insurance plan, I confirmed that any HRT would be covered, but was never able to use that coverage, because Winona has a policy against working with insurance companies (or, apparently, answering patient questions if the purpose of the questions is related to using insurance). That became my primary reason for deciding to go with an in-network, NAMS certified doctor instead of Winona - because I didn’t want to keep spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket on medication my insurance would otherwise cover.",17 July 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-07-18T23:16:17.000Z,"We are deeply sorry to hear that Winona was not right for you, TG, but, unfortunately, we cannot locate an account under your name as it is listed here.As each woman is unique, her symptoms will also be unique, so we prescribe customized, bioidentical HRT treatment plans. HRT is prescribed based on symptoms, as is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and NAMS, as well as the AMA. Blood hormone levels can vary greatly from day-to-day, so blood tests are not necessarily an accurate indication of what you might need. Bloodwork can appear ""perfect"" on paper, but you still may have symptoms.Our Winona doctors carefully review your onboarding questionnaire and health history information that you provide before any medications are prescribed to you.  Not all women will qualify for a treatment plan, so if you are prescribed a treatment plan, you can be assured that you are an ideal candidate for HRT. Some women do experience acne when first starting DHEA, as it is converted to Estrogen and Testosterone in the body. It is a safe, more gentler way to get the Testosterone that women need without the pure Testosterone side effects.  However, it is often short lived and resolves as your body adjusts to the influx of hormones. We know it is hard to be patient during this time!We are not able to bill your insurance company for you, but we never refuse to provide receipts that you may submit to your insurance company for possible reimbursement.  The receipts can be downloaded from your Patient Portal at any time, or can be sent to you by contacting our Patient Care team. Our Winona doctors and staff are always willing to assist you in any way possible with whatever you need. We are saddened to see the review of your experience and would like to help resolve the situation. Please contact our Patient Care team at hello@bywinona.com.We look forward to hearing from you!"

Our doctors do not speak on the phone, or communicate through zoom calls, to protect your privacy. They continue to maintain hospital hours, and they do not want to breach your confidentiality accidentally by someone listening on their end, or yours. We are glad to hear that your personal doctor is onboard with HRT, but please know that it is not prescribed based on lab work. Blood hormone levels can vary greatly from day-to-day, so blood tests are not necessarily an accurate indication of what you might need. Bloodwork can appear ""perfect"" on paper, but you still may have symptoms.HRT is, therefore, prescribed based on symptoms and medical history. We want you to feel better, not necessarily ""fix"" your lab values.We would be sorry to see you go, but are proud to have helped you find relief so far!"

After years of suffering with constant joint and muscle pain, weight gain, fatigue, not sleeping, bladder leakage, and a whole myriad of other complaints, it took serious and unexplained dental issues that came on out of nowhere to send me to the internet to figure out just what was going on with me after my periodontist told me ""half of my practice is women in their 50's going through the change"".  I then went to my general practitioner and my gynecologist for help, who both confirmed I was likely experiencing menopause (I had a hysterectomy 10 years ago but my ovaries were left) but pretty much told me ""This is the way things are.  You'll get used to it"".  The past 3 years I have been more and more depressed, and these dismissals did not help that.  I found Winona online, and I'm so glad I did.  I figured that given my current mental state, giving it a try wasn't going to hurt.  The ease of the initial questions and having prescriptions on their way to me within a few days honestly made me cry with hope that relief was on its way.  Within 3 days, I was experiencing relief from most of my physical symptoms, but the thing that changed the fastest and most dramatically was my mental state.  I'm not suggesting that hormones will help anyone else's depression, but it certainly helped mine.  It's now been 11 weeks and I am back to who I used to be.  I'm so happy that this site makes treatment available to women who need it, and it scares me to think of just how low my mood was and how much worse it may have gotten. My doctor is fantastic with quick responses and lots of detailed information.  I couldn't be happier that I found this site.  Thank you, Winona!",12 July 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-07-15T14:43:56.000Z,"We are deeply humbled to receive your review, Karen!It is truly rewarding to know that we were able to help you find relief from your symptoms and improve your overall well-being.Sadly, we hear similar stories from other women who are experiencing debilitating symptoms, but often don't associate them with menopause.

I was lost when it came to understanding what was really going on with my body. Things were changing, but I wasn’t sure it was menopause. Things can be vague and confusing. But Winona cleared things up for me and I learned that some of my other symptoms, that I had just relegated to being part of getting older or other things, were actually part of my peri-menopausal experience. They explained a lot and placed me on a low level medication to start.    I must tell you, that within about 4-6 weeks, one of my more disturbing symptoms had cleared. I was having issues with my anger…something that was very unlike me in the past and was the main reason I came to Winona to begin with. It was affecting my daily mood & was afraid of it lashing out at my friends, family, and child. Since starting Winona, I haven’t had one of these rage episodes. My sleep has become more regular & less dependent on sleep aids. My skin has become noticeably less dry…. I am super happy about my decision to try Winona & continue my journey with them.

I had gained 50lbs in less than a year. My family thought that I was crazy!! I had a hysterectomy in 2020, but they left my ovaries. I knew menopause would be coming but I didn't know it would bring all of that! NO ONE TELLS YOU THIS!! I had hot flashes and night sweats, I expected those. But the sleepless nights? NO! I saw Drew Barrymore talking about Winona and I was curious. Then I saw an add on Facebook and thought well maybe the universe is trying to tell me something. So I looked into it. I read the reviews, did more research and read more reviews.  I figured, why not try it. I already feel horrible, it couldn't possibly get any worse. So I took the quiz, chatted with the doctors and was prescribed the estradiol and DHEA. Within the first two weeks, the hot flashes and night sweats stopped! I was pleasantly surprised. Then I slept all night for the first time in a long time. I thought, ok...this may be working. Fast forward to week 10...I feel pretty dang good! My mood has regulated and the joint pain is GONE! So maybe I'm not just getting old! I'm sleeping regularly and have more energy than I have in years. Slowly, I'm losing weight, nothing crazy but my clothes are fitting again.

Truly is life-changing.  They are great to work with, timely in their communication and thorough with explanations and guidance.

The discussion with my doctor via the messaging system was a bit frustrating at times and I'm still unclear as to what the numbers of my dosage actually mean.  I don't need all of the medical jargon but I do like to understand the basics on why the formula should change based on remaining symptoms.  The lag in communication time also is a bit frustrating - - which makes it impossible to have a conversation.

A little weight gain and bloating is also common in the beginning.  However, once your body is at the correct level of hormones, everything should return to normal. We encourage women to consistently take their HRT for at least 3 months before deciding to change their dosage or discontinue their medication.We are happy to hear that your hot flashes have resolved though!  Blood hormone levels change daily, sometimes from hour to hour, so blood testing is not medically recommended or needed.   HRT is prescribed based on symptoms.Every woman will respond differently, and your Winona doctor is happy to help you find just the right dose of HRT to help you see the results you are seeking.

After one short month, my symptoms are gone…I feel the best I have in years and I’ve gotten back into my morning exercise routine since I have energy again. I haven’t had any of the bloating that others have experienced and the weight gain has stopped! I couldn’t be happier than I am with my first experience with Winona!!",04 June 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-06-13T12:43:18.000Z,"We are thrilled to hear about your positive experience with Winona, Aimee!We intentionally make our onboarding process as easy as possible so that you can start your bioidentical HRT quickly.Our doctors are experts at reviewing your symptoms and calculating the exact treatment plan that will get you the most relief as fast as possible.

But...I felt absolutely awful, and literally any symptom associated with menopause, I was having....and full on! I was at my wits end, not getting the sleep I needed, I was in major adrenal fatigue, every day was a struggle just to get up. First, I thought I would just answer the quiz, no commitment and I didn't pull the trigger on ordering my prescribed meds for roughly a week. I'm very holistic when it comes to putting meds in my body, I also have an autoimmune disease, so I have been able to control that naturally the last few years fairly well until my menopause symptoms began full force. Once I began the cream, I had some relief within a few days of noticeably fewer hot flashes, and I actually slept through the night....first time in months. One week later I started my DHEA, and at first had major stomach aches from the pills and bloating....but I was willing to stick with it. I've only been on my Rx's for two weeks, but already so many positives. I'll continue to see if the bloating improves, along with some weight loss....it's been a vicious cycle, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path to feeling like my old self again. Thank you Winona, the FB group, the support online, and the Drs. (at least mine) have been amazing...highly recommend to any woman in the throws of the menopause change!",06 June 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-06-08T00:34:53.000Z,"Your feedback means a lot to us, Mriem!Menopause symptoms can be challenging, so we are glad you are finally feeling like you are on the right path, to finding full relief from your menopause symptoms. :)Our patient care team, as well as your Winona doctor, are always happy to assist you whenever you have questions or concerns.

Luckily my GYN put me on HRT right away (the patch). In spite of the patch, I felt that there were still obvious declines in how I was feeling and negative physical changes in my body. I did research on the detrimental consequences triggered by testosterone decline. Unfortunately, there are no FDA approved testosterone treatments for women and I don't feel comfortable having testosterone medication that is really designed for masc people. I felt DHEA would be a good solution. I've been on it for about 2 weeks. I cannot speak to changes in body composition (although I think my abdomen looks less ""full"" and my waist line looks slimmer - it filled out post-menopause). What I can speak on is how much more alert and energetic I am. I used to have to take a nap everyday and I would still fall alseep at night at an early hour. It felt like an monumental task to work all day, then come home and have to cook dinner or clean up. I also felt mentally slower.Not anymore. About a week after I started taking DHEA, I began to feel like the Energizer Bunny. I haven't felt this much pep since my early 30s (I'm 50 now).What I appreciated about Winona was that the online medical form captured all the info necessary for a doctor to make an informed decision on the therapy that would be best for you. Also, the doctor doesn't write an instant prescription. I've always questioned the sites that do that, like how much attention are you really putting into me if that is being done? I submitted my med info on a Saturday, the doctor got back to me on Monday and the meds were delivered about a week after that.The long ship time of the meds is the only thing I would complain about.",19 May 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-05-21T13:03:22.000Z,"Thanks so much for your feedback, Jennifer!We, of course, always want to help any woman through her menopause journey, but it means even more to us when we can help a woman who has done her research and is cognizant of what menopause may mean for her (especially surgical menopause!)We know that women have other options for their HRT, so choosing Winona above those makes us so proud to assist you!It sounds like your fatigue was very debilitating and was impacting your life.

It is not uncommon to experience some weight gain at the beginning of treatment, but once your body adjusts to the influx of hormones, it should be easier in the later months to address it.HRT is not considered a weight loss drug, but in the right doses, it can help to stop the weight gain roller coaster and return your body to its preferred set point.

2024-09-12 19:29:42,Info for Stephanie,Stephanie,US,Verified,You don’t have to suffer with this!,5.0,2024-05-17T22:43:11.000Z,"I’ve been in perimenopause for years and my doctor said I was “too young.” My mom had her last period at 41, aunt at 43, my grandma at 42 and my sister at 45. I’m 41 now and when I was 38 I went to my obgyn and he ran three separate types tests and all very expensive for autoimmune disorders, thyroid disorders/dysfunctions and my hormone levels. He explained that all tests came back “normal” and that although my hormone levels can FLUCTUATE DAILY he still believed I was too young to be experiencing menopause symptoms. I explained my family history and their ages of their last periods and he recanted the possibility of being too young with my family history but believed I was youthful enough I could handle some night sweats, irregular periods and hot flashes. He said if it was still very bad in another 6 months to a year to come back and we could run those tests again!!! Run them again?!?!?! You just told me they were useless as hormones fluctuate daily!!!!! I felt invisible in my own health care and completely defeated.With Winona I listed my symptoms and I wasn’t labeled a “whiny woman” with what’s wrong and bothering me. I was able to ask questions and express concerns. My concerns (does HRT cause cancer etc) I had researched already and had laid them to rest years ago when I saw my doctor but he wouldn’t listen. Winona listened to my symptoms (so many) and didn’t make me feel like there was an antiquated western medicine man waiting to tell me “its just senile vagina and you’ll be fine, there there” with a pat on the back and a large bill for more tests in my hand. Since I’ve started my HRT, my hot flashes have diminished (not disappeared completely yet), my night sweats are getting more infrequent, my brain fog is clearing, and sudden bouts of anxiety are less frequent. If anything, they listened, and said let’s try this, see how we need to adjust and go from there. I couldn’t get anyone to listen to me before simply because my age wasn’t 50. My treatment is still new, less than a month, on HRT but I’m positive in my results so far and the future continuing them. I wish I would’ve found Winona 3 years ago when I got the bravery to talk to my doctor and was shrugged off. You don’t have to suffer with this! Thank you Winona!",16 May 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-05-19T23:32:21.000Z,"We absolutely hear you and see you, Stephanie!Your story deeply resonates with us because we frequently hear the same complaints from other women about being patronized, degraded, or treated with a condescending attitude by their personal doctors. Perimenopause symptoms can start in your 30's, and if they are bothersome to you, no matter how big or how small, you deserve to have them addressed!The lack of care and understanding in the medical community regarding women and menopause is the reason we were founded....there is no reason for anyone to suffer or to ""see how you are in 6 months"".Every day should be a good day, and you do not need to wait to get relief.

My hot flashes and sleepless nights have almost disappeared completely. The first week I thought my eyes had corrected. I felt like I could see things more clearly and mind mind was working. That has calmed down and I do still feel brain fog and exhaustion. I am waiting to hear back from the doc, but hoping for an increase in strength to see if I can capture that first week feeling for longer. I have not had any of the negative effects.

As someone who was admittedly nervous about delving into hormone replacement therapy, their willingness to patiently answer all my questions and address my concerns put me at ease.Before completing my order, Dr. Antola Lardizabal took the time to ensure that I fully understood the treatment and felt comfortable moving forward. This level of personalized care was immensely reassuring and instilled a sense of trust in their expertise.When the product arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the packaging. Not only was it sturdy and secure, but it also included clear and concise instructions, making it easy to begin my treatment with confidence.Despite my hectic schedule, the follow-up process was seamless. The friendly reminder from Winona's team prompted me to provide feedback on my experience, and I was impressed by their genuine interest in my well-being.Renewing my prescription was a breeze, thanks to the efficiency of Winona's team. The process was quick and easy, allowing me to continue my treatment without any unnecessary hassle.Overall, I couldn't be more satisfied with my experience with Winona and their team. Their professionalism, compassion, and commitment to patient care have made me a loyal customer, and I wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone considering hormone replacement therapy.",11 May 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-05-13T13:59:50.000Z,"Thank you Lisa for this AMAZING review! :)This is exactly how we want every single patient experience to be.

I also noticed this as a red flag when they require a credit card to sign up for a free subscription that consists of free messages to the doctor and you only pay for hormones. It seems that if you ask too many questions, they will cut you off because that's what happened to me. My doctor said the plan wasn't for me after I questioned why they sell the estradiol by itself in tablet form if the estradiol and estriol combo is the best combo (her previous statement).

Patients agree to a subscription upon checkout and sign an agreement.  We are very clear and upfront about this. The only cost associated with your treatment plan is for the medication itself.  We do not charge you for the virtual doctor visit, follow-ups with the doctor, the ability to message your doctor, pharmacy fees, or subscription fees. We also ship your treatments to you for free, always.  Our Winona doctors are board-certified and specialize in the care of women going through the menopause transition.  They are professional, caring, and very astute at determining what type of care a woman may need. Asking questions is encouraged, but if our doctors do not feel that an online platform is appropriate for some patients, they are upfront about this so as not to waste anyone's time. We care about the health and safety of our patients, and take into account the appropriateness of each individual treatment plan because that is what we specialize in.  Each woman will have a different menopause journey, and we strive to provide customized care.  We are sorry if we are not the right fit for you!"

When I reached out to Dr. Green, he was dismissive and of little help. I have since looked up his HealthGrades and it seems like my experience with him is quite common. I asked to be assigned to a new doctor, who hasn’t responded. Admins police posts in the Facebook group…if you say anything remotely critical about Winona, they deny your post under the guise of “you asked for medical advice,” yet I see PLENTY of approved posts asking for medical advice! (My post did not ask for medical advice, by the way…I asked if others had experienced similar side effects as me). Winona is a scam that readily took hundreds of non-refundable dollars from me and then didn’t care at all to help me when I reached out in suffering. *Update* They claim to not have me in their database as a customer, but it’s likely because I cancelled my subscription yesterday. I wish I could attach a photo of the cream I have from them to prove it.

Other creams and potions that are sold over the counter contain a fraction of the dose of hormones needed to be effective. In the case where some creams contain real, active hormones, the dose is negligent. They may also contain hormone precursors that sound impressive but aren't actually active in the body.

They just went off the questions and didn't look at levels. At my 10 wk follow up i let the dr know i wasn't sleeping well. I had back to back periods. I wasnt feeling well. I thought maybe i needed to up the level. I talked to the Dr. No real questions asked. She approved. 3 days on increased mg per the dr's instruction to do 3 pumps instead of 2 while i wait for updated prescription to come in. I ended up in the er due a hellacios migraine, puking, dizzy, soapy taste in my mouth and not able to use my right hand. The er dr said do not take the cream. 2 days later I got into my chiropractor for the migraine adjustment.  He tested me for the need of estrogen/progesterone cream. I did not need it. He also said do not take. Lesson learned.  Do not take anything unless you are tested first.  I will not ever recommend or support this online company or any company that does not check levels first.",08 April 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-04-17T12:38:39.000Z,"Tammy, we apologize for any frustration, but your Winona doctor did communicate back and forth with you several times regarding your symptoms and your request to adjust your medications. Blood hormone levels can vary greatly from day-to-day, so blood tests are not necessarily an accurate indication of what you might need. Bloodwork can appear ""perfect"" on paper, but you still may have symptoms.In accordance with NAMS and ACOG, bloodwork is not needed to prescribe HRT.  It is, therefore, prescribed based on symptoms and medical history. Your Winona doctor did provide guidance and suggestions for you and explained that it can take time for you body to adjust to the hormones. The menopause transition can have lots of ups and downs along the way, and that is why our doctors check in with you periodically to provide any adjustments that you may need. You did not respond back to her regarding her suggestions and instead canceled your account. We wish you the best!"

One minute I was at the top of my athletic career , the next minute I have all these weird injuries, I have no endurance and I standing in the mirror, asking myself ""where did all this body fat come from?"" I was having at least 10-15 hot flashes a day and night sweats were 1.5- 2 hrs apart, my sleep was horrible , so after about 4 hrs of interrupted sleep, why bother anymore, I would just get up and start another long day . Then after some research and having that talk with myself - I decided to give Winona a try.  I joined the face book group and read postings everyday, It helped me stay the course when I felt like it wasn't working at times.  So my advise is stay the course, they suggest give it 8-10 weeks. Be patient, this is a whole new you. I am at 10 weeks and I am sleeping so hard. I wake up so refreshed. My night sweats havens been around for about 4 weeks now, I only get a hot flash from time to time but I have found some food triggers them . My evil now is chocolate, hot sauce and fried foods. The DHEA makes me feel like the energizer bunny when I take it mid morning. I'm still trying to adjust my macros/ meals and timings to see what works best for me now as the DHEA suppresses my appetite- Cream at night before bed.  My weight training is going well- lifting heavier. I love cardio so that's getting better again. I did gain 8lbs it seemed like over night - working on that both mentally and physically.

I’ve been going through perimenopause for a couple of years, not really realizing that’s what it was. I was angry at my husband all of the time, for no reason! I had terrible night sweats and hot flashes. With the night sweats, I was getting no sleep, so that just compounded everything else. And of course, I was gaining weight with each year that passed. When my night sweats got so bad that I basically wasn’t sleeping at all, I knew something had to change. A Winona ad came across my IG so I decided to look into it and HRT in general. Winona made it so easy to get. The instructions said it could take 90 days to get relief, but I had relief within literally days! My hot flashes and night sweats ceased within the first week. I felt a noticeable difference in my mood. I felt hopeful and happy for the first time in two years. I felt like I had awoken from a terrible dream. I just finished my third month and I am a different person. My skin even looks so much better and healthier. My husband says I’m a different person! I’m so thankful I found Winona and took the leap. It’s an easy process and is affordable. I’ll never be without!",01 April 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-04-10T13:02:08.000Z,"We are so humbled and grateful to be able to help you, Shelly!The vast majority of women are not prepared for the life-altering changes that accompany their menopause transition.  Symptoms can affect every system in our body and leave us angry, confused, and feeling betrayed.  Our loved ones often don't understand or know how to help either. In addition to a lack of dependable information for women, there is an even greater lack of doctors willing to help women deal with their symptoms. Winona is trying to change that!We do recommend allowing 10-12 weeks for your body to adjust to the influx of hormones, so we are thrilled that you started to see major improvement so soon....that is a testament to how much your body was craving a balance of hormones. Thank you so much for trusting us with your HRT!"

Our Winona doctor was not aware of your frustration or concerns until you completed your 10 week Follow Up.  Sometimes women can have a cycle again upon starting HRT, and this is normal. When a woman has low levels of hormones for a while, and then introduces them again, it can trigger your body into having a cycle. However, the initial periods often go away.  We understand that it is frustrating though!  Our Winona doctors are available for any questions or concerns you have along the way and to reassure you of the changes you may experience."

I was shocked at how easy a process it was to get bioidentical hormone replacement therapy tailored to my symptoms. Within a day or two my cream was shipped. I told my primary care physician what I was doing and what my experience had been with the OB-GYN and he's been nothing but supportive. We're going to run labs every few months just to stay on top of my health. But the truth is, I feel fantastic! I was really suffering from inflammation, puffiness, hair loss, skin issues, vagina problems, extreme fatigue, trouble sleeping, and brain fog. I was getting random things like issues in my shoulder and neck and now those are all gone. The inflammation went away within DAYS of starting the cream. The other symptoms have taken a bit longer to resolve. I did have about a week of dryness down there, but I just lessened the cream dose and it went away! I'm back to my regular dose without issues so my body must just have been adjusting to the hormonal changes. I am so grateful to have found Winona!",27 March 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-03-28T13:06:33.000Z,"And we are so grateful to be able to help you, Rachel!We are saddened to hear that your OB/GYN was not able, or not willing, to help you.

I was impressed by how in-depth the host and doctors were with the attendees' menopause-related questions, including mine. They took the time to answer every single one and there were many situations to address.I then decided to do the online consultation. My situation, like everyone's is unique because I had a partial hysterectomy and have one ovary left. Since my period stopping wasn't an indicator and I wasn't having night sweats or hot flashes, I had no idea how I could tell if I was in perimenopause. Their symptom guide and intake form were very thorough in helping you think through all the symptoms related to menopause whether you realized that's what they were or not! You also fill in your personal questions for the doctor and what type of treatment options you are interested in.You have to upload some personal information like a photo, a copy of your ID, and payment information. Then after you submit it takes a day or two to have a doctor review your information and prescribe your products. The only thing I wish they did differently is ask you to approve your products before processing them. I received my cream and supplements within a few days. I started the cream first for about a week and it has truly been life-changing. I'm sleeping more soundly and my mood is much better regulated. I forgot the cream one day and I could really tell a difference, particularly in my mood. I'm just now starting the supplement and think it's too soon to offer additional feedback on it.

I really wish I would have known about this sooner going through menopause for several years. Suffering in silence, I was constantly reading, trying to find some help for the night sweats the moodiness, the depression, the anxiety I was feeling fear of going anywhere weight gain nausea. I felt like my life was over. It just kept getting worse and worse I really thought I was losing my mind, I thought is nobody else going through this like me then I found Winona at first I was very skeptical because I don’t trust anything. I find on the Internet but I was desperate. I figured it says it has a moneyback guarantee. It’s worth a try at that point I would’ve done anything for some relief. my PCP was not much help in this area. Winona was easy, straightforward. got my prescriptions and OMG within three days of using 50-50 cream and then DHEA. Wow. Unbelievable felt like a new person. I actually was excited to wake up in the morning. I wanted to get showered, put on clothes, not sweatpants. Put make up on do my hair like I used to be I actually wanted to go out and experience life again and it just got better and better every day. I have not even been on it for very long and the difference is night and day to think that I had been suffering all this time and this was the answer.so easy. sometimes I sit and read all the reviews and I can’t believe , when women are saying everything I’ve been saying about my symptoms. It’s almost like they’re in my head. All of us can’t be wrong. If you’re hesitant don’t be.don’t suffer any longer try it you won’t be sorry like I said, I’ve only been on it for a short period of time and 95% of my symptoms are completely gone and I’m sure in time it will be 100% everybody at Winona is so nice helpful and they do know what they’re talking about.

2024-09-12 19:30:14,Info for Tamara D.,Tamara D.,US,Verified,Chinese Medicine Doctoral Student Chose BHRT over Herbal Medicine,5.0,2024-03-19T17:35:40.000Z,"I am a Chinese medicine doctoral student. Naturally, my first inclination was to make lifestyle and diet changes first when menopause symptoms arrived in January 2024 and my body went haywire with hot flashes, night sweats etc. I adopted a vegan whole food plant based diet as well as swimming and was able to reduce 90 percent of my symptoms. However, the remaining 10 percent of symptoms were still interrupting my daily functioning. Chinese herbs are not as robust as BHRT in treating menopausal symptoms. I am not saying that they can’t be effective as an option, It would just take time for them to begin to address your symptoms. In addition, you would need to have access to a practitioner who could create a custom formulation for you. As insurance companies do not cover Chinese herbal medicine, many practitioners do not prescribe them. Menopause is complex and presents risk factors for women that include bone health, cardiovascular health etc. So, I opted for BHRT via Winona knowing that I could still supplement with herbs at a later time as well as continue to utilize acupuncture while utilizing BHRT. The process was straightforward and simple. I consulted with a doctor. Got my prescription in days. 3 weeks in my symptom severity has reduced. I chose cream for delivery of estrogen and progesterone because i swim and was worried about wearing a patch. I also was prescribed DHEA. As my body continues to adjust to BHRT, I expect by the time I have my follow up appointment, I will be entirely symptom free. I have not experienced any side effects to date from BHRT. Once I have been on Winona BHRT for a year, I can make a decision as to whether I need to supplement with Chinese herbal medicine or not. As Chinese herbs used to treat menopause symptoms may have an estrogenic effect, you would not want to take them initially when you begin BHRT. If you decide BHRT is right for you, I highly recommend using Winona. The process is a breeze, pricing is reasonable, and their prescriptions are high quality. It is not necessary to suffer with symptoms when BHRT can help you make a smoother menopause transition. Taking the plunge still requires that you maintain a nutrient dense diet and active lifestyle.",13 March 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-03-19T12:36:55.000Z,"We are truly humbled, Tamara, by your kind words about Winona!Even medical professionals, who are proactive and well-educated about their health, can experience debilitating symptoms related to menopause, despite their best efforts to resolve them.

Migraines, hot flashes, terrible mood swings, weight gain and felt horrible pretty much daily. I tried numerous supplements, vitamins, diets, and talked to my family doctor, my endocrinologist and gynecologist but all three said “it’s not menopause, don’t worry about it until you stop having a menstrual cycle”. They were no help at all and I thought that it was just with age. Then I came across an ad for Winona so I did some research on perimenopause. A whole world opened up to me because virtually all my symptoms were a carbon copy of perimenopause. I set up a free appointment online with Winona and answered the questions. About a week later I received the 50/50 compound and DHEA with instructions along with the convenience of being able to message the doctor anytime. I tell you the difference is night and day! I felt changes within two weeks and now after three months in my migraines are a memory, hardly no mood swings and hot flashes are almost nonexistent.I tried so many things, wasted so much time and money before finding Winona.

They don’t have anything special to offer except a pretty website. This company makes a lot of promises about helping you quickly and providing specialized medicines, but it’s not true. All they really do is send your information to a doctor pool (some random doctor calls you days later) and then they ship you their branded hormones. Nothing is specially designed or mixed just for you; you just choose a couple of their premade options. So don’t be fooled by the marketing! Take the time to Google for a women’s health specialist in your state who offers telehealth calls. A regular doctor can see you right away, quicker than Winona, and a regular doctor can choose from many available medications on the market that are right for you, not just one proprietary product. When I pointed out these things to Winona’s customer service agent they replied, “I have made no promises to you” and removed my name from the doctor pool request.",05 March 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-03-06T16:05:24.000Z,"We are sorry, Elsie, but we are unable to locate an account under your name.As we provide prescription medications, we must comply with state licensing requirements and have a board certified and  licensed doctor on our team who is licensed to prescribe in your state.

Hormone levels can vary greatly from day-to-day, so blood tests are not necessarily an accurate indication of what you might need. Bloodwork can appear ""perfect"" on paper, but you still may have symptoms.Your body is more sensitive than a lab test, so if you are having symptoms, then your hormone levels are fluctuating. HRT is, therefore, prescribed based on symptoms and medical history. We want you to feel better, not necessarily ""fix"" your lab values.We are so happy to help guide you through your menopause journey, so please reach out to your Winona doctor anytime you have a question or concern :)"

I'm 53 this year...I started experiencing perimenopause symptoms when I was 42.  In the last couple of years my symptoms became unmanageable yet my ""numbers"" always show I'm in the ""average"" range and not in perimenopause.  It's maddening when your doctor tells you that feeling this way is just part of being a woman.  I had put on 40 pounds in less than 6 months with zero lifestyle or dietary changes.  I couldn't sleep, night sweats were horrible.   I decided after 2 YEARS of struggling to try Winona...I'm only a few weeks in but within 2 days I slept through the night for the first time in recent memory...night sweats greatly decreased...the biggest change has been in my energy level  I feel like the ""blinders"" came off.  I'm so excited to see what is to come after a couple more months using Winona.  So far, this has drastically improved my quality of life.  I have nothing to gain by posting this.  My hope is that other women like me can find the same life changing relief I have.  I come from a family of pharmacists and doctors.   I don't just go rogue and try whatever.   My decision to take my female health was borne of desperation...but I did my research first.  I can't say enough how impressed I am with Winona and the results I have achieved so far.  I cannot wait to see what happens after a couple of months.",02 March 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-03-04T01:13:06.000Z,"We are truly humbled by your kind words, Sallie, and only wish that you had found Winona sooner!Unfortunately, there seems to be a pervasive, apathetic, and resigned societal reaction to any woman who complains about menopause symptoms....even from their own doctor!  Women do not need to suffer!Bloodwork can, indeed, be perfect on paper, but symptoms may still be severe and impact your quality of life. It IS  maddening when no one will listen!We are overjoyed that your symptoms are starting to resolve so quickly and that you are feeling so much better.....a testament to how much your body needed to replenish those hormones :)"

Most women see some improvement within the first few weeks, but other things like weight loss, can take extended time.

I was skeptical at first . Worried they were going to tell me 46 is too young and try to sell me some crap I didn’t need. I’ve seen numerous doctors for the past several years for insomnia without any relief. Sleep study, total waste. Here, take Bezos or antidepressants, was a common solution. Started with severe night sweats at age 38.  Those went away but then other symptoms began later such as vaginal atrophy, pretty bad. Gyno gave estrogen cream but I had to use much more than recommended for relief. Began having night sweats again recently and hot flashes. Had been to two hormone specialists who wouldn’t prescribe estradiol. “Not until after menopause”.  If you’re like me, do you realize how much suffering a woman will go through before being “eligible” in their eyes? My biggest concern of all was debilitating brain fog.  I was so concerned I would have early dementia.  I had even forgotten the spelling of my last name once, a name I’ve had my whole life! Couldn’t sleep couldn’t think totally miserable but recently I’ve been feeling better.  Got on with Winona and started the oral estradiol. It’s amazing that I am beginning to sleep again, brain fog is lifting and I just feel better!  The weird things my heart was doing has stopped too! Don’t need any messy creams for atrophy anymore. I was happy they had set me up with a real Dr who has been great so far.  The meds shipped right away. So far so good! My only regret is not starting sooner! This has saved my life, dramatic perhaps but I was feeling incredibly hopeless. Depressed as hell too.

2024-09-12 19:30:27,Info for JO,JO,US,,Hoping for great results!,3.0,2024-02-20T17:57:28.000Z,"Update 2/20/24: I wanted to update this because I did have some success once I posted this review, but it shouldn’t take a bad review to get support. Right after my post, I received direct outreach from a great rep who let me know that I wasn’t hearing back from my doctor because they had apparently quit and the notification hadn’t gone out to folks who needed to know. I was immediately reassigned a new doctor, who promptly reached out. I was also finally able to get to speak with a pharmacist, which was helpful but still didn’t entirely answer my question about equivalencies between the cream and patch but at least I’m getting somewhere. Deciding to give ByWinona a chance and see if this can help me. Original post: Like myself, many women will already be taking HRT and may be switching to the cream product to address possible absorption issues (e.g., poor absorption of the estradiol patch). However, it is necessary to understand the equivalent dosages between the different types of HRT (tablets, cream, gel, spray or patch). Despite multiple messages in to By Winona to find out from a doctor how the 2.5 mg cream compares in strength to my .1 estradiol patch, I heard back once, early on, and it did not answer my question. I was assured by customer service agents that I would get an answer and it has been weeks with no answer. The concern that brought me to Winona is either that I’m not absorbing well with the .1 patch or the dosage is too low since I’ve been on this strength for some time. So, if the 2.5 mg cream is actually equivalent to a .1 patch or  less than a .1 patch, the cream will likely do me no good. I like the convenience of being able to quickly access HRT online but do not like not having access to medical professionals for easy questions.",24 January 2024,Reply from By Winona,2024-02-06T18:14:47.000Z,Hello Jo!We are unable to locate you as a patient under this name.

I have hot flashes, mood swings, gained like 40 pounds and sleep all the time. Depressed. Not myself. I just could not find anyone who would listen to me and try to help me. I tried Winona and once I was approved and assigned to a doctor I was able to get a prescription. It wasn't an over night thing either. It was about a week for my approval because I did have some test results waiting to be confirmed. The doctor that was assigned to me also made me feel relieved to hear that she was working with Winona because she was also tried and frustrated with the medical field and the lack of help women had at this stage in life to help find some relief. I explained to her my responses from my doctors and how I was to just deal with it. Why did the medical field has so many options for males but none for women. I was really happy to hear how she wanted to help make a change in the field for us women out there who are struggling with menopause. I am only on my first week of taking the prescribe meds.

Unfortunately, we hear a lot of women say that their doctors want to give them antidepressants.  You don't have a deficiency of Prozac....you have a deficiency of Estrogen!   Dr. Green, and ALL of our Winona doctors, know that we are sometimes a last resort for women who are frustrated, tired, angry, and overwhelmed with symptoms but get no answers from their doctors as to why they feel that way. Or worse, they are just outright ignored!  As you have experienced, bloodwork can appear perfect on paper, but that is just a snapshot in time.  Hormones fluctuate (hello hot flash!), so HRT is prescribed based on your specific symptoms.  We want you to FEEL better, regardless of what your bloodwork shows. Symptoms are real, and you deserve to be able to manage them if they are impacting your life.  Thank you for trusting us!"

The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is that the cream rubs off very easily leaving marks on your clothes. I had to stop using it in the morning before work. The cream does not stain.

The hot flashes have subsided and I feel so much better!I finally got to see my primary physician and she requested a full lab panel that came back showing my hormones were in range with 1 exception.

It's really helped! I do wish they would also offer low dose testosterone for women as that can really make a huge difference in libido and overall hormone balance. Women need a small amount of T as well as Estrogen and Progesterone. My functional doctor prescribed it to me previously, but she closed her practice and I was without a doctor. When I started with Winona I asked about it but they said they don't prescribe T at all which makes it an incomplete service as I still have to find another doctor who will prescribe T. Then I will probably leave Winona just to simplify.",11 December 2023,Reply from By Winona,2023-12-13T15:14:54.000Z,"We understand, Maya, that it is frustrating to not be able to receive Testosterone from Winona.  Testosterone is a controlled substance and there are restrictions around its use, especially when it comes to online prescriptions. Testosterone therapy also requires routine bloodwork. While we don't offer testosterone therapy, we do provide DHEA (Dehydroepiandrosterone) therapy, as a safer alternative with similar benefits!

I have gained weight, my joints ache slightly and my emotions seem a bit more frustrated/flustered than previously.  It may be the holidays or something else - but I have reservations.  I received no reply at all from the doctor - rather I received 2 emails from Winona that they filled both prescriptions (and filled them early too as I still have plenty of both) and charged me for them.

I was on estrogen cream and progesterone pills from my gynecologist. My hot flashes and other symptoms were completely gone. I switched from my gynecologists prescription to Winona because I lost my insurance. My hot flashes came back and it was like torture. I emailed and kept saying this was happening. The first two months were a waste of my money. I paid for having extremely horrible hot flashes. The Winona doctor said to keep going and I’d adjust. I did and they did not improve. In the third month, he switched me to a higher dose. Hot flashes are still here but less intense. This stuff does not seem to work like the real stuff that the non Winona doctors prescribe. It’s supposedly at a higher dose than my gyno prescribed, but works way less. The pump shoots out different amounts each time as well. How can it work if you’re constantly receiving a different dosage?",06 December 2023,Reply from By Winona,2023-12-12T14:36:32.000Z,Hello! Thank you for the feedback!

It's a big step to admit that something isn't right with a woman's body.

First and foremost my brain fog has almost completely lifted! My husband and I relocated to our lake home 2 yrs ago and both changed jobs after over 25 years at our previous. I can’t tell you how painfully slow the learning curve was for me due to forgetfulness/anxiety. Looking back I attribute a majority of this to my depleting hormones. I was also experiencing heart palpitations during any physical exercise & also experienced a decline in muscle mass & strength. (My last period was 1.5 yrs ago but 2.5 years since my last normal one) Since starting I can exercise again like before & slowly feeling like my old self!! One more bonus: My hairloss has decreased immensely! I am sooo thankful for bywinona products and their helpful team during this process!! I look forward to greater gains and maybe even a slowdown of my thin skin on my face!! I spread the word to all my peri/post menopausal friends!!

And, I would get some relief, but never enough for me to recommend any of the products to someone else. However, By Winona is different. It is the REAL DEAL!

2024-09-12 19:30:53,Info for Janice  Jayde,Janice  Jayde,US,Verified,My experience was good at first...then AWFUL,1.0,2023-12-15T18:25:10.000Z,"NB:**WINONA tried to get this post flagged for incorrect etc content, cannot verbatim remember the wording but anyhow, they tried to stop my/this review from being posted, as they tried with other postings here, this speaks volumes. Trying to silence someone** This is my experience and my opinion on how WINONA can improve or not, the choice is theirs. My experience was good at first, everyone @ WINONA was very personable and responsive. I should have expected the latter since they want your business and money so as to get you in the door. Approximately a few months in it was awful. My weight went up and I ended up with HORRIBLE ACNE. Customer service was unresponsive sometimes, and when they did respond very unhelpful, technical assistance was non-existent, and The doctor assigned to me, may have been too busy or just didn't care, as he too was repetitive with his answers and NEVER addressed fully my questions. My assigned Doctor, in my opinion, did not remember me, yet I was assigned to him. When I pressed him about the medication and needing help with acne, sleep, and weight, and how it was causing depression, he not only repeated something he said to me a month ago but seemed to get agitated with me and did what he commonly does which is to say, 'Speak to your PCP.' So, I stayed on the medication until I could find something else.  I truly wanted help with my sleep as well as other hormonal issues, so when I reached out, there were at first crickets, then came the repetitive responses, and in general no help especially for help with my sleep. The Dr. had non-existent bedside manners, nearing my time with them. When it came time for my review with them, I did not get to speak to my doctor, instead, I got another generic questionnaire asking me if I still wanted to use their products...there wasn't any personalisation for medication going forward, what happened to...'A program tailored to your needs' WINONA? What Winona can do is get to know their clientele, and treat them as people, people who need help. Re-train your customer service department so they ALL know the SAME protocol, and rid your culture of using the same repetitive, unhelpful responses to questions, we are all individuals with unique hormonal issues, and giving the same general repetitive answers only serves to infuriate those who need help...comes across as un-sympathetic and full of apathy... the latter should be extended to the Dr. I had assigned to me.Allow EVERYONE to honestly and sincerely post on your FB/Facebook group, it has become imbalanced, and biased, mostly allowing the 'good' experiences to remain in the threads/posts, your FB admin is quick to delete or block you from this group if comments are to the contrary, I have seen this.  WINONA why aren't you lab testing your clients beforehand to see where their hormone levels are before prescribing medication instead of using your VERY GENERAL questionnaire that is just archaic? I would never recommend nor be inclined to use their services again nor recommend family or friends.  My ACTUAL experience/time with WINONA was in 2022...just in case WINONA posts that they cannot locate me as a patient. I would have posted this earlier but did not receive this Trustpilot until recently. AWFUL EXPERIENCE with this entity. If you are reading this, in MY OPINION, companies should allow all to review their experiences regardless of whether it was 'good' or 'bad' This is what such platforms as this are for, it is all about honesty.RESPONSE TO THE TEPID RESPONSE FROM WINONA 10 27 2023 & 12 15 2023Had a text from WINONA this morning stating a similar response to the one posted here and 'wishing me the best' LOL. I told WINONA, that it was not only the TIMING of your responses but also the  QUALITY of the CONTENT via phone or email that added to my experience, if you cannot deduce this from my review posted here, understand now via this response. Customer service responses to me were made in the WINONA typical time which was past 24 hours, sometimes longer (not really acceptable.) Like I said in my response to you this morning via text WINONA, I wish you the 'best' and you are now blocked! 12/15/2023 - CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS FURTHER TRAINING!!As for the email, my email has been the same since the 90's and I ALWAYS use the same email for personal data which I provided to you. I have NUMEROUS correspondence from you from the very beginning using the very same email I provided to you and I have been using for decades of which you used, sigh WINONA I have proof/receipts of documentation I received from you using the very same email address I provided you.

It’s the primary reason I tried them for three months.Unfortunately, they did not work for me (as noted in my original review, my symptoms of hot flashes and night sweats returned). I also said I found the sign up process and doctor responsiveness to be good. But you ignored those positive remarks because you only care about removing or diminishing women who give less than 4 or 5 star reviews. My biggest disappointment with Winona is the ongoing forced engagement through bullish marketing tactics that have occurred via direct text, review reply, and flagging of my reviews as “harmful or illegal”. I hope other women are now aware that if this product doesn’t end up working for you and you leave an honest review — you may be subjected to the same ploys of trying to pay you to remove your review, claiming you aren’t a patient or that you did not work with your doctor to adjust your dosages, and that your reviews are “harmful or illegal” without cause.

I am sleeping better with less night sweats, but have not noticed any other improvements with issues such as weight, energy, mood, anxiety, etc. I am continuing my dose for another 90 days hoping to see some additional positive changes.

This had not happened before. After doing research and chatting with friends I set up a gynecologist appointment that was 6 weeks away…… Fortunately the internet knows what you are up to and recommended ads.

This could not have been easier or more efficient!  I started noticing an improvement a couple weeks in and at 3 weeks woke up and noticed my face looked Really good (improved skin is apparently a side effect of HRT).I am a month in and feel improvement and assume this will continue to help me get back to where I need to be!

We understand that this can be a difficult and frustrating situation.It's worth noting that while your body adjusts to the HRT, it is not uncommon to experience bloating and water weight gain. However, it's important to note that weight gain is not directly linked to HRT.

Bloodwork can appear ""perfect"" on paper, but you still may have symptoms.HRT is, therefore, prescribed based on symptoms and medical history. We want you to feel better, not necessarily ""fix"" your lab values. The information provided in the onboarding process is used to determine what medications and what dosage would work best for you. Our Winona doctors are very successful in safely prescribing HRT for thousands of women through this process. We understand your concern about returning the medications, but they are prescriptions that are formulated for each patient and cannot be used again for another patient. We encourage you to reach out to your Winona doctor to discuss and they can fully explain how this process works and why they prescribed the medications that they did. We truly want you to feel better! If we can help in any way, please let us know."

I am 6 weeks into treatment and my hot flashes have greatly diminished to a few times a day from countless a day.  I have gained a few (more) pounds since I started, and my Winona doctor feels it's water weight gain in response to the estrogen and suggested a diuretic for what is hopefully a temporary issue.  I just began sleeping better with less night sweats, but I think I am still far away from what I would call a good night's sleep.

Don't waste your hard-earned time & money visiting your local doctor b/c not only do they not care about women's issues, but their lack of knowledge regarding female anatomy & our basic biological functions regarding hormonal fluctuations is alarming.Within approximately one week, the symptoms that have been negatively affecting your day to day life & relationships, will dissipate. Additionally, Winona's telehealth process & delivery methods are timely & efficient. Their Q & A doctor portal is fantastic whenever you have an inquiry or concern. Dr. Green typically responds within 24 hours or less. The reason I cannot give ByWinona 5 stars is due to the lack of efficacy of DHEA with regard to increasing sexual desire. Though it is thought to help convert to testosterone, and therefore, increase sex drive, after about 6 months, I have not experienced these results even though my prescription was increased from 25 mgs per day of DHEA to 50 mgs nearly 3 months ago. Therefore, if you are struggling with arousal issues, something stronger is needed. Studies have shown a lack of efficacy for DHEA, especially at such low levels. Though it is a banned substance in athletics, typically, athletes who use it to enhance performance, are taking upwarda of 200 to 400 mgs per day, which could result in adverse effects.My advice to Dr. Green would be to connect clients to local doctors who will prescribe testosterone to replace what we normally lose as we age; especially during menopause. On average, pre-menopausal women have one tenth the amount of testosterone in men. Combined with estrogen & progesterone, the testosterone we naturally have when we're very young, jump-starts female arousal, desire, fantasies, pleasure & of course,orgasm.The other alternative would be for  the doctor AND patient to file with the DEA to receive permission to send the controlled substance (in this case, testosterone) through mail-order. However, I understand the complexities of such a system.Regardless, if you're suffering from the plethora of menopausal symptoms I've described above, ByWinona, will most definitely alleviate those issues, and you can get your life back. Hopefully, Dr. Green will find a more effective alternative to DHEA. This issue is just as important & life-changing for women as it is for men. In fact, it's even more crucial for women, since sexual dysfunction is often overlooked and ignored by the mainstream medical field.",15 June 2023,,,

The Winona RX of Estrogen/Progesterone cream and DHEA have resulted most of my symptoms subsiding completely!  I am extremely pleased and wish I had tried this sooner! Everyone's needs are different though, and for myself particularly, only the use of evening primrose oil three times a has helped to keep my hot flashes and night sweats at bay.  If I miss one dose of three per day, the hot flashes come right back within a couple hours.  So for me the Winona is not helping with those particular symptoms.  It has however given me my brain back (which also allowed me to keep my business open), I sleep great now, weight is stable and easier to lose, hair growing back, mood is great and no anxiety, and no aches and pains.  It has not helped me personally with low libido or atrophy.  I found another solution for the atrophy, a low dose estriol cream called Silky Peach by Parlor Games. That has helped immensely!!!  Nithing is helping me with my libido issues yet, but they may just be mental after dealing with so much pain for over a year. I have very little pain now so long as I stay consistent with applications of Silky Peach.   Anyway, definitely give Winona a try but be patient, especially if you've allowed your hormones to get off balance for a long period of time.  It takes months to balance out and everyone is different.  Winona has seriously contributed to giving me my life and sanity back!",20 May 2023,,,

I got an email saying I had to respond within 12 hours to avoid the prescription being shipped!!!! The only reason I caught this was because the card I used was my Apple Card and I get instant notifications.I emailed them and they said they’d take care of it, for now it appears that they have. No one should be subject to jumping through hoops to avoid continuing with a product that clearly required a doctors review before sending, according to their email anyway.

But signs and symptoms can give you an idea what’s really going on that may not be “caught” on any given day or time of a blood draw.  The physician was very thorough.  I started the topical estrogen/progesterone and within 8 days I was sleeping better and no night sweats and within a couple more days my hot flashes resolved.  I started 02/02 and haven’t had any hot flashes in a few weeks now (as of 03/26). And the very best part:  my heart palpitations are almost completely resolved.  With my hormonal changes I started experiencing heart palpitations.  My cardiologist believed it could be related to hormones but did his due diligence with the work up, which was all normal.

I started off with more night sweats then anything, So going on no sleep, I could barely function. My mood was all over the place. I went to my PC and was put on hormone therapy then. Sometime later they said I need to get off them, never really said why. I didn’t have any kind of problems with them and no health issues. Didn’t take long and I was miserable! That’s when I realized it gets so much worse then just night sweats. Just the intensity of all of it was more then I could bare! Went to a different practice to get help. That’s when they were just pushing antidepressants with all there side affects on me. It was crazy to me that they thought antidepressants were better then the hormones were. Told me nothing else they could do for me😠Finally found a practitioner that put me back on low does hormones again, thank goodness! As the years have gone by so many more things have become an issue. Mood, anxiety and very very low libido. I would bring it up at doctor visits but it was pretty much them telling me you just have to except it, you are getting older you know🤯 Not good enough! Women should not have to live like that no matter what age.So I was feeling like there was nothing I could do, nobody would help. I couldn’t afford the pellets with all the fees and labs that goes along with it. Then I was doing a web search, I think for low libido, and Winona popped up. Was so excited that finally there was someone to help! The process was so easy! Just gave COMPLETE health history and my symptoms, and my hormone therapy was on its way. I do feel your symptoms are much more important then some lab work to figure out what you need to be your best self. I have been on hormone therapy through Winona for a little over 3 months. Still dialing in on my prescription strength, but my next 3 month prescription is on its way, and hopefully we got things figured out. I’m also on the DHEA and all I can say is my hubby is a very happy man these last few weeks☺️I would like to see Winona be able to start prescribing testosterone, I think that would be wonderful, and helpful to so many women. But till then I will continue the DHEA. I have been very impressed with all Winona has done for me. I will be with them as long as I can, hopefully that’s forever!Its all been so promising since I found Winona that I can grow old with loving life again!

About a year ago I started experiencing hot flashes, weight gain, sad/moodiness, and felt truly miserable. I started looking into different options as well as discussed it with my OB/GYN, and kept being told that I pretty much just had to “deal with it!” and it was “a phase that I would eventually get through”. I must add that ever since that conversation I also changed my doctor! Nevertheless, in my research I came across Winona. After reading, and seeing all of the positive reviews, I felt I should give it a try, what did I have to lose at this point? As soon as I started taking the topical cream and taking the DHEA pills, I noticed a difference in me within less than two weeks. My mood was more positive, I wasn’t so tired as I had been, the night sweats stopped, the weight gain stopped, and here I am sharing this wonderful experience with all of you. The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish I would’ve found this sooner! It has been a fabulous journey, and I am so glad I got on the Winona bandwagon! I truly hope it works for you as it has for me, and all women that raved about these products. Lastly, I need to add that their customer service is absolutely hands-down, a five-star experience all in itself.

I had been trying for years during premenopause and perimenopause to balance my hormones.  I am a believer in vitamin supplements, eating well, and keeping sugar intake to a minimum.  I think that has helped for sure, but I needed more.  I read Dr. John Lee’s famous books and decided to use progesterone cream by itself for a while, and it worked at first.  When it stopped working to reduce symptoms, I tried an over the counter combined progesterone and phytoestrogen cream.  It seemed to make symptoms worse.  I then started on Amberen.  It helped me with many of my symptoms and for a short time helped with hot flashes.  Soon, the hot flashes and night sweats came rushing back.  I was so ready to get serious about starting BHRT.  I had wanted to for several years, but finding a doctor who specialized was going to be expensive.  Most wanted to do lots of sex hormone testing on a regular basis which can be quite costly.  Then I came across the Winona website.  I took a chance and I’m so glad I did.  The hot flashes and night sweats are gone.  I am sleeping much better, and most of the time all the way through the night without getting up once.  Also, intimacy with my husband is not painful (wink, wink).  If you are on the fence about BHRT, give it a try — you’ve got nothing to lose!",03 February 2023,,,

The website has all the information available on how it works and I appreciated that the main doctor hosts a Q&A they publish to YouTube each month. I filled out an online questionnaire and selected my preference for pills or creams and 1 or 3 month supply.  They assigned a doctor and I was able to find him online, reading reviews left by his private practice patients (who love him based on all the 5 star reviews).  We messaged back and forth via Winona's secure online portal and he prescribed the medications.  Within a week I was seeing a difference (most people take longer - I was lucky).  Within 2 months all my perimenopause symptoms were 99% gone and I'd regained my life.  I can message my doctor via the portal 24/7/365 and he responds every morning and evening (7 days a week).  I really like him!!  I'm now in month 4 and I only wish I'd found Winona sooner!!  I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone experiencing perimenopause or menopause symptoms.

I have been taking both daily now for 10 weeks and no hot flashes or night sweats. These have been the only symptons of pre-menopause for me and I hope that continues. So far so good!

I had heard back from customer service but because I did not check the chat after I initiated it, I did not see it.   The next day I re-contacted customer service to follow up on my shipment and as to why it had run out a couple of weeks early. After customer service inquired as to how often I was using it, I realized my mistake and was using too much. The instructions were clear, but my foggy brain read them wrong when I first received the prescription! However, the Winona Team was so caring and responsive in getting my shipment out to me as quickly as possible that all of my fears and worries just went away.

During a follow up, I said the treatment wasn’t working for me, the response was, “Keep going. HRT takes time to kick in.”  I did my 10 week follow up and the doctor response was basically, “Sorry it didn’t work. Try something different with a local provider.”  Very, very disappointing and a waste of time.  In the meantime, the company is very disjointed and there’s no communication within departments.  If someone reaches out to ask how it’s going, you can’t get help from that person.  They will direct you to someone else, who then directs you to someone else.  If your doctor says sorry, try something different, the company doesn’t know you’ve been dropped like a hot potato and will continue to try to charge your credit card indefinitely.

I felt like I was trapped in a stranger’s body. Poor sleep, dry skin, joints that hurt all the time, packed on 20+ pounds in less than a year  and NO sex drive. The worst was the sex drive. It hurt my heart because my husband and I had always shared this beautiful, intimate physical love that mirrored our feelings for each other. Conceptually, I wanted sex, but it was just too much effort  suddenly. I also had began to hate my body, the body that had weathered so much and given life to 3 children. The one I should have been proud of. I had doctors’ say, “Yep, menopause sucks,” and “deal with it.” There seemed to be no hope.So I took a risk. Did this thing online. Took a quiz. Corresponded with a doctor and got some meds from Winona. The process was easy. The service was great. I feel that I am in control now and have choices.I have more energy, I feel better. I am starting to recognize this 56 year old body again. It will be a long journey back to my desired shape.

Within the first 2 weeks of using the estrogen/progesterone creme, I was sleeping through the night and not overheating. My mind was calmer, and I felt less anxious. I started genuinely enjoying life, family and friends more. I continue to learn from the live Q&A sessions and the Facebook group. When I have a question or need help fine tuning my symptoms, I always get a response from Dr. Green through the portal. With the help from Winona, I am finding my balance again. I appreciate the respect, kindness, and genuine professional care.",21 September 2022,,,

While your body adjusts to the HRT it isn't uncommon to experience bloating and water weight.Contrary to common belief, weight gain is not linked to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) In fact, most studies suggest that the use of HRT is associated with less fat gain and potential beneficial effects on muscle mass. Our chief medical officer discusses it more here: https://youtu.be/5bZ33tLsUcc.  Your Winona doctor is available to you in the patient portal 7 days a week! He or she would be happy to offer suggestions or adjust your dose so we can help you get rid of the extra weight. We are here for you so please do not hesitate to reach out so we can help."

If any woman is considering HRT and you need to learn more ,then Winona has doctors that will answer your questions as well as informational videos like "" most commonly asked questions."" Everything about Perimenopause, menopause, the medications and ways they can be administered . You will find clear information about using the service itself and about insurance acceptance....all those details. Now the most fantastic thing is it is easy , affordable, safe and you will get so much relief and feel like yourself again. HRT also helps us women to better protect our bodies in the future. Hormones help with so much like keeping our blood vessels elastic . Since using Winona I have experienced great benefits like, no more bladder issues, my blood pressure is in the average range of between 114 to 125 over 70 to 82! Before my average was 148 over 85. My appetite has become stable and normal. I dont have food cravings all the time for sweets and I don't feel hungry at weird hours. When I eat I know when I'm full. I have more energy and  I noticed that the shape of my body is changing. It looks like im loosing a little weight or that my weight isn't concentrated is my midsection so much. My skin doesn't get as dry and itchy and neither does my vagina. That area is much more comfortable feeling .  I  have also mentally and emotionally been feeling better. I'm not in a weird forgetful fog and I feel more like myself. When your body isn't right you "" feel"" it in other ways. It's strange but I felt ""off"" . After about a week and a half I slowly started feel balanced out in my head and emotions. I'm really excited and so glad that I decided to do this with Winona because it has been absolutely beneficial to me in so many ways.  I had no idea how important this would be for me but I encourage all women in Perimenopause or menopause  learn through Winona about HRT and how it can benefit your health and well being. I recommend downloading the app. God Bless",23 August 2022,,,

2024-09-12 19:31:39,Info for Stacy L.,Stacy L.,US,,"Beware, perimenopausal users!",2.0,2022-08-19T20:05:39.000Z,"One of the reasons so many doctors don't think HRT is a good idea for perimenopausal women is because we're still producing our own hormones. Adding extra hormones in, while they ""may"" help with certain issues, more than likely will cause others. I found Winona online and thought that bHRT might be a good option for me. My skin had fallen apart, my libido was gone, my energy (I thought) was in the tank and I was curious about my options. Night sweats and hot flashes were, thankfully, being controlled by a maca supplement.I ran through the way-too-brief ""medical questionaire"" and was assigned a doctor who very quickly prescribed me a combo estrogen/progesterone cream and DHEA. As luck would have it, I started the cream the day my period started so I was able to track my ""progress"" in line with my regular cycle. Things were great for the first ten days. My period was only a couple days long, unusual for me, and my mood was GREAT. My skin dramatically plumped up (seriously, wrinkles around my eyes were GONE). I felt great, looked great...was only concerned really about how ""too"" energetic I was. I thought it might be the DHEA. On the tenth day though, I plummeted into the worst depression I'd had since I was on birth control 12 years ago. I hated my husband. I was crying nonstop for two days. I couldn't sleep at night and when I was awake, I was anxious and my mind was racing. This is a really scary reaction. My gums became incredibly swollen and sore and I assumed what had happened was I ovulated around day 10 and was now experiencing progesterone overload. The first ten days I had all the Winona estrogen plus my own - and all the benefits of that - and then I had all the Winona progesterone plus my own - and that threw me into the symptoms and problems that got me off the pill a decade earlier. I contacted my doctor and gave him the run-down. I didn't hear back from him for nearly a full 24 hours (I get this isn't probably his full-time gig, but if that's the case, Winona needs a nurse or someone else to talk to when starting this product). His assessment was it sounded like I was getting too much progesterone. Unfortunately, he couldn’t write a new prescription for the same estrogen and less progesterone because the cream apparently only came in two formulations. What? I thought this was supposed to be “compounded specifically for me”? Wasn’t that a benefit of bHRT? That’s how Winona marketed itself. So my only option was essentially, to switch to pills (which I didn’t want, was trying to leave my liver out of this) or try the other formulation of cream. He essentially then asked, “What do you want to do?” I don’t know, I’m not the doctor here!I gave it a couple days to see how things panned out, then messaged him back that things were the same, if not worse. He then told me my symptoms could be caused by too much progesterone, or by too little. Good grief. He recommended increasing the estrogen to counter the progesterone. That was a red flag for me. Any reputable doctor IMO knows that with HRT you should always go for the least amount of hormones possible for symptom relief. I asked him if increasing the estrogen would cause any problems and he essentially said no, my body would ""adjust"" to it. At this point, I was feeling very uncomfortable and didn't want to ""guess"" at what was needed. I cancelled my prescription fourteen days in to the treatment, feeling like I'd been ripped off of $199. I stopped the cream cold turkey and had a very long, very heavy ""withdrawal bleed"" and some teenagerish breakouts. Now, a week later I'm starting to feel ""normal"" again, but back to my saggy skin. At least I don't hate my husband anymore!Of note, a couple days after cancelling my subscription I started getting marketing emails from Winona trying to get me to purchase the product (you guys should know I'm no longer a customer)...and to add insult to injury, one included a coupon code for 40% off!I can't speak to how this product affects post-menopausal women. I suppose it would be much more successful as it truly is ""hormone replacement"", whereas with me it was more ""hormone supplementation"" which is why it affected me like birth control pills did. This was a huge mistake on my part, using this product while my body is still making its own hormones. I'll figure out another way to deal with my symptoms.",19 August 2022,Reply from By Winona,2022-08-23T16:51:33.245Z,"Hi Stacy!Thank you very much for the detailed review. We take all feedback to heart and are currently evaluating internally to see how we can improve.I can say that we do offer significantly more than 2 options in the cream, we'll figure out why that may have been miscommunicated.Also, you should not have received those marketing emails so we're investigating that now.

I am 45 and still have a very regular and predictable period. I spent since I was about 38 convincing myself that no way in the world could I be having hormone issues with a period this regular and seemingly perfect! Well the symptoms slowly grew and grew. You just learn to live with them and it all seems so normal. Starting at around 38 I started getting what we call the meno-belly no matter how I ate or how much I worked out, which is very defeating when you are trying so hard. I was dealing with constant urination, never sleeping due to constant urination, racing thoughts and anxiety. I think I have lived off of about 3-4 hours tops a night of sleep for a long time now. Now here I am at 45 and my symptoms included lack of sleep, constant urination, even more meno-belly (to the point I went and got laser lipo, and it's trying to come back), fatigue, lack of motivation, dry eyes (I didn't even realize this was a symptom), vaginal dryness (this one is no fun), low libido (and I am actually very in love with my husband), severe bloating a good week before period would start and not subsiding til the end of my period, joint pain and stiffness (seems like I was being assigned a new pain/injury every single week), racing thoughts and unable to keep a straight thought, having trouble completing sentences or recalling things I should easily be able to recall, weird little headaches over the top of my left eye. It's hard keeping track of all these symptoms so I may be missing a couple. Skip to now. I am 5 weeks in to my BIO-HRT treatment. My Winona Doctor put me on DHEA and estrogen/progesterone cream. I take my DHEA around 5pm and my cream around 9pm. After 5 weeks I no longer have any of the symptoms listed above, except for the weight loss. That will take a few months to happen so I have to be patient. But I can tell you that I have had one period so far since on the treatment and this period was lighter, I did not get a headache and noticed very little bloating. The period also ended a day sooner than normal. I am sleeping like the dead. Last night I went to bed at 10:00 (my fault, I shouldn't have stayed up watching the movie) and I didn't budge until 5:45am, and that was only because our Pug woke me up. Not having to pee every single 10 minutes is life changing. Not even realizing how dry your eyes truly were until they aren't anymore is life changing. It's all life changing!!! I am kicking myself for not starting this at least 5 years ago. Why did I wait? I can't answer that question. Literally every single symptom I have listed above has improved. I can't believe my libido! My vaginal dryness is completely gone. I am enjoying intimacy again with my husband and this has made him happy again as well. It doesn't only effect me, it effects the people close to me. My mood is stable, I feel calm all the time. I could go on and on all day. I did have a little fatigue at the beginning, kind of like the fatigue I had in my first trimester of my only two pregnancies. It has subsided tremendously just like the doctor said it would. I have energy. As I sit here typing this I just realized I didn't hit my daily 2 o'clock brick wall that I normally hit. I noticed I don't seem to have much appetite. It only seems to be that way because I am not craving anything anymore. I don't know if that's a side effect of treatment or not but I sure will take it. I have already started recommending this to my girlfriends. If you are on the fence, please don't be. Do yourself a favor and don't be like me. Don't be in denial. It takes your body some adjustment but once that phase passes it's all smooth sailing and you will feel amazing. the Winona team is there for you if you have any questions or even feel your treatment should be adjusted. The Facebook support group page is awesome! A couple of my symptoms I found out were actually symptoms because of joining that page. Do it for yourself. Feel better. Don't be afraid. Give it a fair chance and you may very well find that you have changed your life and you can quit suffering needlessly. This day in age no woman should have to suffer. I hope to see you on the FB support page saying how much you love it and sharing your story. Good luck ladies!",03 August 2022,,,

I never thought of doing any type of hormone replacement because I always had heard bad things about that. So I did nothing I coped and did what every other woman did just try to make it through.

I’m 64 with heart disease in my family history so I could only do a vaginal cream and DHEA because of risks. The first time I started Winona they only sent one applicator to use and wash and re use? Which I thought was unsanitary? I did get an infection?? I called the Dr asked if I could get more applicators? He said they only give out one? I had to stop the cream… get treatment from my PCP. Then ordered applicators on my own. Started it again and now no problems. Rough start but I stuck with it. I really don’t think using one applicator for re use is a good idea.,15 July 2022,,,

I started with BioT pellets, which was ok for awhile, they took about 3 weeks to even feel a difference. I was looking to try something else after not using the pellets for about 6 months. I saw an add for Winona and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. I could feel the effects after 2 days. REALLY! Gone are the hot flashes and mood swings. They even help with low libido, not as much as the pellets but what they offer does help. I'm so grateful I decided to give them a try and the process is quick.

I tried everything from natural based capsules to Prescription medication.  I knew my body was changing and my moods were even being effected.  I started to research HRT and came across By Winona. I was skeptical due to not really knowing anything about HRT.  I talked to Dr Green and asked lots of questions, he was very quick to respond back in explaining how HRT works.  I started on the medication he prescribed, after about 4 weeks I started noticing changes in how I was feeling and even loosing a few pounds which I have not been able to do in 5 years. I felt like I was stuck on the same weight no matter what I did. My hot flashes definitely started to resolve. My sleeping patterns changed for the better. I am now at 10 weeks and feel like a new woman.  My boyfriend even noticed changes in my body.  My moods are so much better.  I can not say enough about By Winona.

After working out and working harder, but the scale constantly budging northwards, my skin looking older and older despite an arsenal of products and drinking a lake’s worth of water a day, I had to face facts. I thought “well, why not try hormones” after my Doctor was less than helpful by telling me to try things from the cvs to help. Winona made a world of difference. Immediately.I hadn’t realized that the “sleep” I was getting wasn’t restorative. Within the first few days, I was sleeping deeply and not waking up sweaty. My mental clarity improved. And so did my skin!After a month, my weight stabilized and my old lines started to appear where before I was looking puffy and chunky.I feel like my normal self again! Not the aging brittle version I felt like before I started!I’ve referred at least two friends so far who are having the same results!!!",27 February 2022,,,

Since I have been taking Winona, I have noticed a change in my metal clarity, libido and just over all feeling more like myself again. I am still dealing with my weight and bloating but I’m sure the longer I am on it I will start noticing a difference in that as well.
